# Optimal Nutrition Strategies for Marathon Running

## Introduction  
Marathon running places extreme demands on the body’s energy systems and recovery processes. Optimal nutrition is crucial to fuel training, enhance performance on race day, and aid recovery. Both elite and recreational marathoners benefit from evidence-based dietary strategies, though elites often fine-tune these to a greater degree (e.g. higher absolute intakes and personalized plans) while recreational runners may need to adapt guidelines to their tolerance and lifestyle. In general, **carbohydrates** are the primary fuel for endurance running, **protein** supports muscle recovery, and **fat** provides essential nutrients and a secondary energy source. Adequate **micronutrients** (vitamins and minerals) are needed to sustain performance and health, and certain **supplements** have proven ergogenic benefits for endurance. Below, we break down optimal marathon nutrition by macronutrients, micronutrients, and evidence-backed supplements, and provide practical food examples for both training and race day. Differences between elites and recreational runners are noted where relevant (e.g. elites may sustain higher carb intake during races, whereas recreational runners must be cautious with gastrointestinal comfort and hydration). A summary of key recommendations is provided at the end.

## Macronutrients in Marathon Training and Racing  

Marathoners must balance carbohydrates, proteins, and fats to meet the high energy expenditure of training and racing. The **ratios** often shift during training versus race prep, but all three macros remain important. Timing and quantity of intake are critical – for example, when to carbo-load, how to space protein intake, and minimizing fat around key workouts or race day. Below we discuss each macronutrient:

### Carbohydrates  
**Role & Daily Needs:** Carbohydrates (CHO) are the dominant fuel for marathon running, supplying glucose for muscle glycogen. High daily carb intake is needed to support the heavy training load and to refill glycogen stores between sessions ([

        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6628334/#:~:text=Carbohydrate%20,run%20at%2016%20km%2Fh%20for)) ([
            Nutrition and Supplement Update for the Endurance Athlete: Review and Recommendations - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6628334/#:~:text=Academy%20of%20Nutrition%20and%20Dietetics,29)). Sports nutrition guidelines suggest endurance athletes doing moderate training (~1 hour/day) consume about **5–7 g of carbohydrate per kg body weight per day** (g/kg/day), increasing to **6–10 g/kg/day** for 1–3 hours of training, and up to **8–12 g/kg/day** for extreme high-volume training ([
            Nutrition and Supplement Update for the Endurance Athlete: Review and Recommendations - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6628334/#:~:text=Academy%20of%20Nutrition%20and%20Dietetics,29)). Elite marathoners typically fall on the higher end due to their intense, high-mileage regimens, whereas recreational runners with lower training volume may aim for the middle of these ranges. However, even recreational runners should target the upper ranges on heavy training days to ensure optimal recovery and performance. Carbs are a more oxygen-efficient fuel than fat, yielding more energy (ATP) per liter of O₂; when muscle and liver glycogen run low, fatigue (“hitting the wall”) ensues ([
            Nutrition and Supplement Update for the Endurance Athlete: Review and Recommendations - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6628334/#:~:text=Carbohydrate%20,run%20at%2016%20km%2Fh%20for)). Thus, ample carbohydrate is the foundation of a marathoner’s diet to delay fatigue. 

**Training Considerations:** To **recover optimally** and “train hard” day to day, marathoners should consume enough carbs to fully replenish glycogen after key workouts ([Nutrition strategies for the marathon : fuel for training and racing - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17465604/#:~:text=final%20days%20before%20the%20marathon,benefits%20as%20a%20depletion%20phase)). This generally means prioritizing carbohydrate in each meal and snack around training. Many elites distribute carbs strategically (periodization), sometimes training on slightly lower glycogen to stimulate adaptation, but there is **no strong evidence** that chronic low-carb diets improve endurance training outcomes ([Nutrition strategies for the marathon : fuel for training and racing - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17465604/#:~:text=restoration%20of%20muscle%20glycogen%20between,likely%20to%20happen%20as%20the)). In fact, prolonged low-CHO availability can impair training intensity and performance ([Nutrition strategies for the marathon : fuel for training and racing - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17465604/#:~:text=restoration%20of%20muscle%20glycogen%20between,likely%20to%20happen%20as%20the)). Most research supports a high-carb diet for maximizing training quality. That said, some athletes practice “train low, race high” – occasionally doing base runs with low glycogen (to boost fat oxidation) but always restoring carbs for hard sessions and races ([
            Nutrition and Supplement Update for the Endurance Athlete: Review and Recommendations - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6628334/#:~:text=a%20%E2%80%9Ctrain%20low%E2%80%9D%20strategy%20involving,This%20low%20glucose%20state)) ([
            Nutrition and Supplement Update for the Endurance Athlete: Review and Recommendations - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6628334/#:~:text=70,70)). This approach remains experimental; the consensus is that a balanced high-CHO diet is optimal for marathon training for both recreational and elite runners.

**Race Week & Carb-Loading:** In the final days before a marathon, athletes often **carbohydrate-load** to maximize glycogen stores. For races longer than ~90 minutes (which includes the marathon), a classic *glycogen supercompensation* protocol can improve performance by ~2–3% ([
            Nutrition and Supplement Update for the Endurance Athlete: Review and Recommendations - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6628334/#:~:text=Prior%20to%20the%20race%20,However%20recent)). Modern protocols are more convenient than older methods: simply tapering exercise and consuming ~**10–12 g/kg/day of carbs for 1–2 days** prior to the race is usually sufficient to fully top up muscle glycogen ([
            Nutrition and Supplement Update for the Endurance Athlete: Review and Recommendations - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6628334/#:~:text=Traditionally%20it%20had%20been%20recommended,In%20the)). Research shows you **do not** need a depletion phase of exhaustive exercise followed by a week of high carbs – even a short bout of high-intensity exercise or complete rest, followed by one day of very high carb intake (~10–12 g/kg), can achieve near-maximal glycogen stores ([
            Nutrition and Supplement Update for the Endurance Athlete: Review and Recommendations - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6628334/#:~:text=Traditionally%20it%20had%20been%20recommended,1%E2%80%934%20g%2Fkg%20CHO%20is%20recommended)). During these carb-loading days, runners often reduce fiber and limit very fatty foods to avoid gastrointestinal (GI) bulk; the emphasis is on easily digestible starches and sugars. For example, an elite 70 kg runner might eat on the order of 700 g of carbs per day during carb-loading (e.g. pasta, rice, bread, sports drinks, fruit, low-fiber cereals). A recreational runner will scale this to their body weight – e.g. a 60 kg runner targeting ~600 g carbs in carb-load – which still requires consciously high carb portions. Notably, elite runners have higher absolute intakes and may tolerate ~12 g/kg, whereas recreational runners should aim for at least ~8–10 g/kg if possible ([
            Nutrition and Supplement Update for the Endurance Athlete: Review and Recommendations - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6628334/#:~:text=Academy%20of%20Nutrition%20and%20Dietetics,29)). In both cases, the goal is the same: start the marathon with maximized glycogen stores.

**Pre-Race Meal (Race Morning):** On race day, a final pre-race meal helps top off liver glycogen (which can deplete overnight) and maintain blood sugar. The general guideline is **1–4 g/kg of carbohydrates about 1–4 hours before** the start ([
            Nutrition and Supplement Update for the Endurance Athlete: Review and Recommendations - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6628334/#:~:text=gastrointestinal%20,the%20overnight%20fast%20which%20depletes)). Runners should choose a familiar, easily digestible meal that is high in carbs, moderate in protein, and low in fat and fiber to minimize GI distress ([
            International Society of Sports Nutrition Position Stand: nutritional considerations for single-stage ultra-marathon training and racing - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6839090/#:~:text=the%20event%20,gut%20discomfort%20during%20the%20race)). For example, 2–3 hours before the race an athlete might have oatmeal with a banana and honey, or white toast with peanut butter and a sports drink – providing ~100+ grams of low-GI carbs. Elite runners often eat closer to 3–4 hours prior due to early race start times, while recreational runners might have a lighter breakfast if nerves are high, but **should still aim for ~1–2 g/kg** even in a shorter window (e.g. ~70–140 g for a 70 kg runner a couple hours out). Critical is that the foods are *tried in training* – “nothing new on race day.” As an ISSN position stand emphasizes, the pre-race meal should be **familiar, easily-digestible, rich in low-glycemic carbs, and low in fat/fiber** to avoid gut discomfort ([
            International Society of Sports Nutrition Position Stand: nutritional considerations for single-stage ultra-marathon training and racing - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6839090/#:~:text=the%20event%20,gut%20discomfort%20during%20the%20race)).

**During the Marathon (Carbohydrate Fueling):** Consuming carbohydrates during the race is a proven strategy to maintain blood glucose, delay glycogen depletion, and improve performance. The capacity to absorb and use carbs during exercise is limited, so the recommended intake depends on race duration and individual tolerance. For events like the marathon (~2–5 hours), sports nutrition research suggests targeting **~30–60 grams of carbohydrate per hour**, and well-trained athletes may benefit from up to ~90 g/h in longer races if they have trained their gut to handle it ([Contemporary Nutrition Strategies to Optimize Performance in Distance Runners and Race Walkers - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30747558/#:~:text=CHO,assist%20in%20meeting%20training%2Frace%20nutrition)). Elite marathoners, who complete the race in ~2–2.5 hours, often ingest ~60–80+ g/h (typically via sports drinks and gels) to sustain their high running intensity ([Contemporary Nutrition Strategies to Optimize Performance in Distance Runners and Race Walkers - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30747558/#:~:text=CHO,cooling%20strategies%20may%20provide%20a)). For example, many elites plan ~4–6 energy gels (20–25 g each) over a marathon and supplement with carb-rich drinks to approach the upper intake range. Recreational runners going 4+ hours can also benefit from high carb intake, but they may opt for the lower end (~30–50 g/h) if that is all they can tolerate, since GI issues become more likely at higher intake without acclimatization. Even **small amounts** of carbohydrate can help – for instance, rinsing the mouth with a carbohydrate solution has been shown to improve performance in shorter endurance events, leveraging central nervous system effects ([Contemporary Nutrition Strategies to Optimize Performance in Distance Runners and Race Walkers - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30747558/#:~:text=CHO,cooling%20strategies%20may%20provide%20a)). For the marathon, however, a steady intake is preferred. Practically, runners can consume a gel (≈20–30 g) every 30–45 minutes with water, or sip a sports drink providing ~30–60 g per hour. Products combining multiple carb sources (e.g. glucose + fructose) enable higher absorption rates (~90 g/h) and are used by many elites ([Contemporary Nutrition Strategies to Optimize Performance in Distance Runners and Race Walkers - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30747558/#:~:text=CHO,cooling%20strategies%20may%20provide%20a)). The key is to **practice** fueling during long training runs to train the digestive system. Well-conditioned elite runners often tolerate aggressive carb feeding with minimal issues, whereas recreational runners should build up intake gradually to avoid stomach upset. Nonetheless, the performance benefit of carb fueling during the marathon is substantial for both groups – it spares muscle glycogen and prevents the precipitous drop in blood sugar that causes the infamous “bonk” ([
            Nutrition and Supplement Update for the Endurance Athlete: Review and Recommendations - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6628334/#:~:text=Carbohydrate%20,run%20at%2016%20km%2Fh%20for)).

**Post-Run Recovery (Carbs):** After long training runs and the marathon itself, high-carb foods aid rapid glycogen replenishment. This is most crucial when recovery time is short (e.g. training again the next day). A general recommendation is to ingest **~1.0–1.2 g/kg of carbohydrate in the first hour or two after** intense or long exercise, and continue regular carbohydrate intake in subsequent hours ([
            Carbohydrates and Endurance Exercise: A Narrative Review of a Food First Approach - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10054587/#:~:text=exercise%20event%20to%20ensure%20that,nutritional%20aspect%20to%20consider%20for)). In practice, combining carbs with some protein immediately post-exercise can enhance glycogen re-synthesis and kick-start muscle repair. For example, a recovery drink of 60–80 g glucose with 15–20 g protein (approximately a 3:1 or 4:1 carb:protein ratio) within 30 minutes post-run is a common strategy. High glycemic index carbs (such as white bread, rice, potatoes, or a sports drink) are effective in this window ([Carbohydrates and Endurance Exercise: A Narrative Review of a ...](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10054587/#:~:text=Carbohydrates%20and%20Endurance%20Exercise%3A%20A,and%20improve%20subsequent)) ([
            Carbohydrates and Endurance Exercise: A Narrative Review of a Food First Approach - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10054587/#:~:text=exercise%20event%20to%20ensure%20that,nutritional%20aspect%20to%20consider%20for)). While immediate refueling is less urgent for recreational runners who may have days to recover, it is still beneficial for reducing fatigue and muscle soreness. Both elite and recreational runners should follow a long run or race with a substantial meal rich in carbs to fully restore glycogen over the next 24 hours. As one review notes, the **speed of recovery depends on timing and quantity of carbohydrate** – rapid intake of a large enough amount is needed to maximize glycogen restoration ([
            Carbohydrates and Endurance Exercise: A Narrative Review of a Food First Approach - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10054587/#:~:text=exercise%20event%20to%20ensure%20that,nutritional%20aspect%20to%20consider%20for)). Thus, a post-marathon recovery plan might include an initial snack (e.g. sports drink or chocolate milk and a banana at the finish) followed by a larger meal (e.g. a rice or pasta-based dish) a bit later.

### Protein  
**Role & Daily Needs:** Protein is essential for muscle repair, remodeling, and recovery in endurance athletes. While running is not as muscle-damaging as heavy resistance exercise, marathon training (especially high mileage and downhill running) does cause muscle fiber breakdown, and adequate protein helps optimize training adaptations. Endurance athletes are advised to consume **approximately 1.2–2.0 g of protein per kg body weight per day** ([
            Nutrition and Supplement Update for the Endurance Athlete: Review and Recommendations - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6628334/#:~:text=The%20AND%2C%20DC%2C%20and%20ACSM,lower%20range%2C%20based%20on%20individual)). This is a higher intake than the general population RDA, reflecting greater need for tissue repair and for supporting lean mass. In practice, **1.5 g/kg/day** is often cited as a reasonable target (e.g. ~105 g/day for a 70 kg runner), with elite runners possibly at the upper end if they are balancing heavy training and lean mass maintenance. Notably, some recreational runners (especially those with low-calorie diets) may under-consume protein, risking suboptimal recovery. Both elites and recreational athletes should ensure each day’s meals collectively meet these protein needs.

**Timing and Distribution:** How protein is distributed across the day matters for maximizing muscle protein synthesis. Rather than one large serving, it’s ideal to split protein into moderate doses. Consensus guidelines recommend **~0.3 g/kg of high-quality protein every 3–5 hours** throughout the day ([
            Nutrition and Supplement Update for the Endurance Athlete: Review and Recommendations - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6628334/#:~:text=match%20at%20L504%20performance%20,8)). For a 70 kg runner, 0.3 g/kg is ~21 g protein per feeding – roughly the amount in 3 eggs or a scoop of whey protein. This pattern ensures a steady supply of amino acids for muscle repair. Marathoners should pay special attention to **post-exercise protein** intake. Consuming ~20–30 g protein soon after a key workout or race (within 30-60 minutes) helps stimulate muscle repair and adaptation ([
            Nutrition and Supplement Update for the Endurance Athlete: Review and Recommendations - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6628334/#:~:text=match%20at%20L504%20performance%20,8)). For example, following a long run, one might have Greek yogurt with fruit, a protein shake, or a tuna sandwich to supply protein along with carbs. Interestingly, ingesting a small amount of protein *before* or *during* exercise has been studied (to reduce muscle damage or supply extra fuel), but for marathons this is generally not necessary and can cause GI distress. The focus should be on pre-loading carbs and then taking protein **after** the run for recovery ([
            Nutrition and Supplement Update for the Endurance Athlete: Review and Recommendations - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6628334/#:~:text=3%E2%80%935%20h%29%20or%200,exercise)). During ultra-endurance events (beyond marathon length), some protein or BCAAs during the race might help minimize muscle breakdown, but for a marathon there’s no strong evidence that mid-race protein improves performance. What is important is **consistent daily intake**: both elites and recreational runners should include protein-rich foods in each meal (e.g. eggs, dairy, lean meat, fish, legumes, tofu) to meet the 1.2–2.0 g/kg goal ([
            Nutrition and Supplement Update for the Endurance Athlete: Review and Recommendations - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6628334/#:~:text=The%20AND%2C%20DC%2C%20and%20ACSM,lower%20range%2C%20based%20on%20individual)). This supports better recovery so the athlete can handle high training volumes. 

**Race-Day Protein:** On the day of competition, protein is not a primary fuel, but a small amount in the pre-race meal can help satiety and provide amino acids to curb muscle breakdown. For instance, having a little protein (10–20 g, such as a small serving of whey or some peanut butter) in the breakfast 2–3h before the marathon is fine, but one should avoid large protein portions that could slow digestion or cause GI upset. During the marathon, most runners consume negligible protein (focus is on carbs and hydration), and that’s fine – the body can rely on stored amino acids for those few hours. After the race, as noted, **protein intake is critical**: aim for ~20 g high-quality protein in the immediate recovery meal to initiate muscle repair ([
            Nutrition and Supplement Update for the Endurance Athlete: Review and Recommendations - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6628334/#:~:text=match%20at%20L504%20performance%20,8)), and continue with regular protein-containing meals/snacks as hunger returns. This will aid in rebuilding any muscle damage from the race and can help immune function as well. 

### Fats  
**Role & Daily Needs:** Dietary fats are a vital component of an endurance athlete’s diet, contributing essential fatty acids for health, aiding in the absorption of fat-soluble vitamins, and providing a dense source of energy. While carbs are the marathoner’s main performance fuel, fats serve as the primary fuel at lower intensities and for longer-duration base training. A common recommendation is that athletes get roughly **20–35% of their total calories from fat**, similar to general healthy eating guidelines. Importantly, **fat should not be overly restricted** – intakes below ~20% of calories are *not* advised for athletes ([
            Nutrition and Supplement Update for the Endurance Athlete: Review and Recommendations - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6628334/#:~:text=match%20at%20L426%20Fat%20Do,race%20if%20GI%20comfort%20concerns)), as very low-fat diets can impair absorption of fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, K) and potentially affect hormone levels. In absolute terms, many marathoners will consume ~1–1.5 g/kg of fat per day (which for a 70 kg runner might be 70–105 g of fat daily, though usually we think in percentage of calories). Both elite and recreational runners should include healthy fats (e.g. nuts, seeds, olive oil, avocado, fatty fish) in their daily diet for overall health and inflammation modulation. These foods provide omega-3 fatty acids and monounsaturated fats that support cardiovascular health and may assist recovery. 

**Fat as Fuel and “Training Low”:** Marathon running relies more on carbohydrate at race pace, but fat is a significant fuel source, especially for longer training runs at moderate intensity. Well-trained athletes become very efficient at oxidizing fat – an adaptation that spares glycogen. In fact, elites typically have such well-developed fat metabolism that even when their glycogen is nearly exhausted after hours of exercise, they can continue at a moderate pace by burning fat and lactate ([
            Nutrition and Supplement Update for the Endurance Athlete: Review and Recommendations - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6628334/#:~:text=outlined%20below,consider%20this%20when%20counseling%20athletes)). This partially explains how an elite can avoid complete collapse even when “running on fumes.” Some endurance athletes experiment with high-fat, low-carb (HFLC) diets or ketogenic diets to further enhance fat oxidation. While HFLC diets do increase fat-burning capacity, they usually *reduce* the ability to utilize carbohydrate at high intensities. Current evidence does not show performance benefits of a long-term high-fat, low-carb diet for marathons ([Nutrition strategies for the marathon : fuel for training and racing - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17465604/#:~:text=restoration%20of%20muscle%20glycogen%20between,likely%20to%20happen%20as%20the)). In fact, chronically low-carb intake can compromise training intensity and lead to slower race times for most runners ([Nutrition strategies for the marathon : fuel for training and racing - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17465604/#:~:text=restoration%20of%20muscle%20glycogen%20between,likely%20to%20happen%20as%20the)). As noted earlier, a periodized approach (occasionally training with low glycogen) can be a tool, but the competition strategy is invariably high carbohydrate (“**train low, race high**” concept) ([
            Nutrition and Supplement Update for the Endurance Athlete: Review and Recommendations - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6628334/#:~:text=70,70)). Therefore, the general advice is to consume adequate fat for health and satiety, but **prioritize carbs** for fueling intense workouts and races.

**Timing – When to Limit Fat:** One scenario where fat intake is consciously limited is around key high-CHO time points, because fat can slow digestion. For example, in the **1–2 days of carb-loading** before a marathon, runners often reduce fat intake (and fiber) to allow room for more carbs and to avoid GI issues ([
            Nutrition and Supplement Update for the Endurance Athlete: Review and Recommendations - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6628334/#:~:text=Fat%20Do%20not%20restrict%20to,race%20if%20GI%20comfort%20concerns)). Similarly, the **pre-race meal** should not be heavy in fat – e.g. avoid greasy foods on race morning, as they delay gastric emptying and could cause discomfort ([
            International Society of Sports Nutrition Position Stand: nutritional considerations for single-stage ultra-marathon training and racing - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6839090/#:~:text=the%20event%20,gut%20discomfort%20during%20the%20race)). But outside of those specific windows, marathoners should eat balanced meals including some fat. There is no need to follow an extremely low-fat diet during the training season; doing so could leave an athlete constantly hungry and even at risk for fat-soluble vitamin deficiencies. **At least ~20% of calories from fat** is recommended ([
            Nutrition and Supplement Update for the Endurance Athlete: Review and Recommendations - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6628334/#:~:text=match%20at%20L426%20Fat%20Do,race%20if%20GI%20comfort%20concerns)), and many athletes do well with ~30% for adequate energy. For instance, a diet of 3,000 kcal for a high-training elite could include ~80 g of fat (which is ~25% of kcal). For a recreational runner eating 2,500 kcal, ~70 g fat (~25%) would be reasonable. Emphasis should be on “quality” fats: nuts, nut butter, olive or canola oil, avocado, oily fish (salmon, sardines) and flax/chia provide beneficial fats and anti-inflammatory omega-3s, which can aid recovery. Saturated fats (butter, fatty meats) can be included in moderation, but ultra-processed high-fat junk foods should be limited as they provide poor nutrient value. In summary, **fat is a necessary part of the marathon diet for health and baseline energy needs**, but intake should be moderated so as not to crowd out carbohydrates. During competition phases, minimize high-fat foods in the meals immediately before running or during the race. 

*Difference between Elite and Recreational Runners:* Generally, macro-nutrient principles apply similarly to elites and recreational runners, but **elite runners** often operate closer to the upper limits of carb intake (both daily and during races) and have nutritionists fine-tuning their plans. **Recreational runners** might not always meet ideal carb targets due to lifestyle or knowledge gaps – for instance, many amateur runners inadvertently eat too little carbohydrate and experience “bonking” mid-race. Similarly, some recreational runners under-eat protein (especially if trying to lose weight concurrently), which can hinder recovery. Elites, on the other hand, tend to be meticulous about protein intake to prevent injuries and promote adaptation. In terms of fat, recreational runners sometimes go too low (in misguided efforts to lose weight quickly) or too high (following fad diets). Elites usually maintain a balanced intake, using fat mainly for general nutrition rather than fuel. A notable difference is gut training: elites regularly practice consuming 60–90 g/h of carbs in training and thus can aggressively fuel on race day, whereas a recreational runner might only manage 30–50 g/h without GI upset. Each individual is unique, but broadly, the **same guidelines (high carbs, moderate protein, moderate fat)** are the starting point – the differences are in fine-tuning quantities to body size and training load. Importantly, any runner – novice or Olympian – will benefit from **fuelling adequately** rather than trying to “run a marathon on fumes.”

## Micronutrients: Key Vitamins and Minerals for Marathoners  

While macronutrients supply energy and building blocks, **micronutrients** (vitamins and minerals) play vital roles in oxygen transport, bone health, muscle contraction, and energy metabolism. Endurance training can increase the demand for certain micronutrients, and deficiencies can impede performance. Marathon runners should aim to meet or exceed the Recommended Dietary Intakes for all vitamins and minerals through a varied, nutrient-dense diet. Here we highlight a few micronutrients that are particularly important for endurance performance and recovery: **iron**, **magnesium**, and **sodium (plus other electrolytes)**. We also briefly note others like calcium, vitamin D, and potassium. These nutrients are critical for both elite and recreational runners, though those without professional guidance (often recreational athletes) should be especially mindful to avoid hidden deficiencies.

### Iron  
**Why It’s Important:** Iron is absolutely crucial for endurance athletes because it’s a core component of hemoglobin and myoglobin, the proteins that carry oxygen in blood and muscle. High aerobic performance depends on robust oxygen delivery to muscles; if iron stores are low, the body’s capacity to transport oxygen drops, leading to fatigue. **Iron deficiency**, even without progressing to anemia, can impair muscle function and limit endurance capacity ([
            Exploring the Relationship between Micronutrients and Athletic Performance: A Comprehensive Scientific Systematic Review of the Literature in Sports Medicine - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10302780/#:~:text=Iron%20deficiency%2C%20whether%20combined%20with,61)). In other words, a marathoner low in iron will struggle to sustain training paces and may feel excessive fatigue. Chronic iron deficiency undermines both performance and the adaptations to training (like increasing VO₂max). 

**Risk Factors for Runners:** Marathoners have several risk factors for iron depletion. Iron is lost through sweat, and runners (especially high-mileage elites) also experience “footstrike hemolysis” – the pounding of feet can break red blood cells in capillaries, leading to iron loss over time. Female runners are at particular risk due to menstrual iron losses and typically lower dietary iron intake. Vegetarians and vegans must be vigilant, as plant-based iron (non-heme iron) has lower bioavailability than heme iron from animal foods. Additionally, heavy training can elevate hepcidin (an iron-regulating hormone) temporarily, which reduces iron absorption in the hours post-exercise. All these factors mean marathoners, especially elites or those with restrictive diets, often have increased iron needs. It is not uncommon for sports dietitians to monitor serum ferritin (iron stores) in elite runners and intervene if levels drop too low.

**Meeting Iron Needs:** The best approach is to consume iron-rich foods regularly. Heme iron sources such as red meat (beef, venison, lamb), poultry, and fish are well-absorbed. Plant sources like beans, lentils, tofu, spinach, and fortified cereals contribute as well; pairing them with vitamin C (e.g. citrus, berries, bell peppers) can enhance non-heme iron absorption. For example, a stir-fry with beef and broccoli or oatmeal with raisins and strawberries can improve iron uptake. The recommended dietary allowance (RDA) for iron is ~18 mg/day for premenopausal women and 8 mg/day for men, but athletes may need more. Many female marathoners target ~20+ mg/day through diet and supplements if needed. **Supplementation:** Iron supplements (ferrous sulfate, etc.) should only be used under guidance when a deficiency is identified. Research shows iron supplementation can improve performance **only if the athlete is iron-deficient**; taking high-dose iron when you are already sufficient won’t boost performance and may cause gut issues ([
            Exploring the Relationship between Micronutrients and Athletic Performance: A Comprehensive Scientific Systematic Review of the Literature in Sports Medicine - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10302780/#:~:text=,149)). In fact, excessive iron can interfere with other minerals (like zinc) and cause oxidative stress. Therefore, runners should get periodic blood checks for ferritin and hemoglobin, especially if they experience fatigue or poor performance. If levels are low, an iron supplement can significantly improve energy and recovery ([
            Exploring the Relationship between Micronutrients and Athletic Performance: A Comprehensive Scientific Systematic Review of the Literature in Sports Medicine - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10302780/#:~:text=Iron%20deficiency%2C%20whether%20combined%20with,Dairy%20products%2C%20sardines%20and%20salmon)). If levels are normal, focus on maintaining a diet with iron-rich foods. Both elite and age-group runners have experienced performance slumps from unrecognized iron deficiency – so this is a **critical micronutrient** to monitor.

### Magnesium  
**Why It’s Important:** Magnesium (Mg) is involved in **hundreds of enzymatic reactions** in the body, including those related to energy production (ATP synthesis) and muscle and nerve function. For endurance athletes, magnesium plays a key role in muscle contraction and relaxation, and it contributes to the structural development of bone. Perhaps most importantly, magnesium is required for steps in oxidative energy metabolism – so if magnesium status is suboptimal, an athlete might experience quicker onset of fatigue. Research indicates that marginal magnesium deficiency can impair exercise performance and amplify the negative consequences of strenuous exercise ([Maximize performance with magnesium! - USA Triathlon](https://www.usatriathlon.org/articles/recovery/maximize-performance-with-magnesium#:~:text=Maximize%20performance%20with%20magnesium%21%20,negative%20consequences%20of%20strenuous%20exercise)). In other words, without enough magnesium, a runner may not be able to perform at their best or recover optimally. Some studies have found a direct correlation between high physical activity levels and increased magnesium requirements ([
            Exploring the Relationship between Micronutrients and Athletic Performance: A Comprehensive Scientific Systematic Review of the Literature in Sports Medicine - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10302780/#:~:text=,and%20found%20a%20direct%20correlation)). This makes sense: athletes lose magnesium through sweat and urine, and their metabolic demand for Mg in working muscles is elevated. 

**Signs of Low Magnesium and Prevalence:** Magnesium deficiency can manifest as muscle cramps, tremors, or excessive soreness, but even without obvious symptoms, many people have inadequate magnesium intake. Athletes may not realize they are insufficient. Magnesium also has a role in modulating inflammation; insufficient magnesium can fail to counteract the pro-inflammatory stress of exercise ([
            Exploring the Relationship between Micronutrients and Athletic Performance: A Comprehensive Scientific Systematic Review of the Literature in Sports Medicine - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10302780/#:~:text=Athletes%20who%20are%20insufficient%20in,increase%20the%20risk%20of%20hypertension)). Additionally, low Mg can contribute to insomnia or poor sleep quality, which further hampers recovery. While full deficiency (hypomagnesemia) is uncommon, even a mild insufficiency could hinder a marathoner’s recovery and performance. Both elites and recreational runners should ensure they meet the **Recommended Intake** (RDA for magnesium is about **400 mg/day for men and 310 mg/day for women** ([
            Exploring the Relationship between Micronutrients and Athletic Performance: A Comprehensive Scientific Systematic Review of the Literature in Sports Medicine - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10302780/#:~:text=Magnesium%20,66))). Notably, some dietary surveys of athletes show suboptimal magnesium intake, especially in those who restrict calories or avoid magnesium-rich foods.

**Food Sources and Strategies:** The good news is that magnesium is widely available in healthy foods. Excellent sources include nuts and seeds (almonds, peanuts, cashews, pumpkin seeds), legumes (beans, lentils), whole grains (brown rice, whole wheat, quinoa), and leafy green vegetables (spinach, kale). For instance, 1 ounce of almonds provides ~80 mg Mg, a cup of cooked spinach ~150 mg, and a cup of black beans ~120 mg. Including these foods daily can easily reach the ~300–400 mg target ([
            Exploring the Relationship between Micronutrients and Athletic Performance: A Comprehensive Scientific Systematic Review of the Literature in Sports Medicine - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10302780/#:~:text=Magnesium%20,66)). A marathoner’s diet rich in whole grains and veggies often covers magnesium, but during periods of heavy training (or if the athlete has a very high sweat rate in hot weather), additional magnesium may be beneficial. Some athletes take magnesium supplements or use electrolyte powders that include magnesium, especially if they experience frequent cramps. There is some evidence that magnesium supplementation in deficient individuals can improve exercise performance ([
            Exploring the Relationship between Micronutrients and Athletic Performance: A Comprehensive Scientific Systematic Review of the Literature in Sports Medicine - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10302780/#:~:text=,and%20found%20a%20direct%20correlation)). However, mega-dosing magnesium is not necessary if diet is adequate – any excess is usually excreted, and extremely high supplements can cause diarrhea (magnesium is a component of some laxatives). A balanced approach is to ensure daily diet provides magnesium, and if lab tests or symptoms suggest low Mg, consider a modest supplement (e.g. magnesium citrate ~200-300 mg). It’s also worth noting magnesium’s interplay with vitamin D and calcium in bone health and muscle function: all need to be sufficient for optimal performance. 

In summary, **magnesium is crucial for marathoners’ energy metabolism and neuromuscular function**. Both elites and recreational runners should consume magnesium-rich whole foods daily. This helps maintain muscle performance and may reduce risk of cramps and excessive post-run soreness. If an athlete’s diet is lacking (for example, some convenience-heavy diets could be low in Mg), correcting that is a priority. Ensuring adequate magnesium will support the high training loads by keeping the body’s enzymes and muscles working efficiently ([

### Sodium and Electrolytes  
**Why They Matter:** *Electrolytes* – particularly **sodium** – are minerals that maintain fluid balance, nerve conduction, and muscle contractions. Sodium (along with potassium, chloride, magnesium, etc.) is lost in sweat during exercise. Marathon runners can lose a significant amount of sodium in a lengthy race, especially in warm weather or if they are heavy sweaters (some individuals lose >1.5 liters of sweat per hour, each liter containing around 1 g of sodium on average ([
            Nutrition and Supplement Update for the Endurance Athlete: Review and Recommendations - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6628334/#:~:text=during%20exercise%20in%20athletes%20with,sports%20drink%20containing%20sodium%20in)) ([
            Nutrition and Supplement Update for the Endurance Athlete: Review and Recommendations - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6628334/#:~:text=average%20sweat%20rates%20range%20from,sports%20drink%20containing%20sodium%20in))). If these losses are not replaced, blood sodium levels can drop, leading to hyponatremia, or at minimum the runner may suffer muscle cramps, fatigue, or dizziness. **Sodium is the most critical electrolyte to replace during endurance exercise** because it’s lost in the greatest quantity. It helps maintain blood volume and ward off dehydration. Potassium, magnesium, and calcium also play roles in muscle function, but sodium imbalance is the primary concern in long races.

**Hydration and Sodium Strategy:** Both elite and recreational marathoners need a personalized hydration strategy, including electrolyte replacement. However, their approaches may differ: elites often tolerate some dehydration (finishing 2–4% body weight down) to avoid carrying extra fluid weight, and they generally have access to sports drinks and personal bottles with electrolytes during the race. Recreational runners, especially slower ones, are actually at higher risk of *over*-drinking water without enough sodium, which can cause dilutional hyponatremia. In fact, cases of severe hyponatremia have mostly occurred in back-of-the-pack marathoners who consumed large volumes of plain water over 4–6 hours. This can be life-threatening. Therefore, current guidelines emphasize drinking **to thirst** or at a moderate rate, and including sodium to match sweat losses, rather than force-drinking excessive fluids ([
            Nutrition and Supplement Update for the Endurance Athlete: Review and Recommendations - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6628334/#:~:text=400%E2%80%93800%20mL%2Fh%20,content%2C%20intensity%20of%20exercise%2C%20body)) ([
            Nutrition and Supplement Update for the Endurance Athlete: Review and Recommendations - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6628334/#:~:text=match%20at%20L737%20illustrated%20in,40)). The American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) suggests a starting point of about **400–800 mL of fluid per hour** for marathon-type efforts, adjusting to conditions and individual needs ([
            Nutrition and Supplement Update for the Endurance Athlete: Review and Recommendations - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6628334/#:~:text=400%E2%80%93800%20mL%2Fh%20,content%2C%20intensity%20of%20exercise%2C%20body)). Faster or heavier runners in hot conditions will be on the higher end; slower or lighter runners in cool conditions on the lower end ([
            Nutrition and Supplement Update for the Endurance Athlete: Review and Recommendations - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6628334/#:~:text=match%20at%20L705%20factors,kg%20athlete%20in%20cool%20or)). 

Within that fluid, they recommend **including sodium** for longer races. A typical guideline is around **300–600 mg of sodium per hour** for prolonged exercise ([
            Nutrition and Supplement Update for the Endurance Athlete: Review and Recommendations - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6628334/#:~:text=match%20at%20L726%20commercial%20sports,discussed%20in%20Recovery%20Nutrition%20section)), with higher amounts if the athlete has very salty sweat or is in extreme heat. For example, consuming a sports drink that provides ~200 mg sodium per 8 oz, at a rate of 16–24 oz (0.5–0.75 L) per hour, would yield ~400–600 mg sodium/hour – which is in line with recommendations ([
            Nutrition and Supplement Update for the Endurance Athlete: Review and Recommendations - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6628334/#:~:text=match%20at%20L726%20commercial%20sports,discussed%20in%20Recovery%20Nutrition%20section)). Many commercial sports drinks and gels are formulated with sodium. Additionally, runners who sweat heavily or cramp easily might use salt tablets or electrolyte capsules during the race (each typically contains ~200–300 mg sodium along with other electrolytes). It’s wise to **practice** this in training to fine-tune the amount that maintains performance without causing bloating. 

**Electrolyte Balance and Performance:** Maintaining sodium levels helps preserve **plasma volume** so that the heart can pump blood effectively to muscles and skin (for cooling). If a runner only drinks water and dilutes their sodium, they may experience headaches, nausea, or cramps as nerves and muscles misfire. On the flip side, dehydration (losing too much water and not replacing it) can also hurt performance and increase cardiovascular strain. So it’s a balance – drink enough to attenuate dehydration, but don’t overdrink beyond thirst, and **ensure some electrolytes are coming in** ([
            Nutrition and Supplement Update for the Endurance Athlete: Review and Recommendations - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6628334/#:~:text=illustrated%20in%20the%202007%20ACSM,40)). Elite runners often finish slightly dehydrated but they typically start well-hydrated and drink at aid stations; they are also less prone to hyponatremia because they race faster (less time to overconsume fluid) and they often use sports drinks. Recreational runners should consciously incorporate electrolytes if running over ~2 hours ([
            Nutrition and Supplement Update for the Endurance Athlete: Review and Recommendations - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6628334/#:~:text=environmental%20conditions,and%20the%20average%20sodium)). This could mean alternating water and sports drink, or taking a electrolyte-rich beverage (with ~500–700 mg/L sodium) throughout. 

**Other Electrolytes:** **Potassium** is another electrolyte lost in sweat, though typically less critical to supplement acutely than sodium. Most sports drinks also contain some potassium (e.g. 50–100 mg per serving) which helps with nerve and muscle cell function. Potassium is generally abundant in foods (fruits, vegetables, dairy); bananas and oranges, for instance, are known runner snacks high in potassium. As long as a runner’s overall diet has plenty of produce, potassium levels will be maintained. **Magnesium** and **calcium** can also be lost in sweat in small amounts. These are usually replenished in the post-run meal. Some runners take magnesium (as mentioned earlier) especially if they struggle with cramps. Calcium needs (about 1,000–1,300 mg/day) should be met through diet to maintain bone health – this is crucial for marathoners to prevent stress fractures. Ensuring adequate calcium and vitamin D is important for any runner logging high mileage ([
            Exploring the Relationship between Micronutrients and Athletic Performance: A Comprehensive Scientific Systematic Review of the Literature in Sports Medicine - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10302780/#:~:text=Calcium%20plays%20a%20crucial%20role,63)), but those aren’t typically lost acutely in a single race (rather, they’re part of long-term nutrition). 

**Summary of Electrolyte Advice:** In marathon context, focus on **sodium replacement and sensible hydration**. Use sports drinks or salty snacks (some runners take pretzels or broth in ultras) during extended runs. Aiming for ~0.5–0.7 g/L of sodium in fluids is a good ballpark. Adjust based on your sweat rate and weather – an athlete with high sweat rate in a hot race may need more (and should consider getting sodium in *ahead* of the race as well, a strategy called pre-loading with a salt solution the evening or morning before to boost fluid retention). Meanwhile, a slower runner in a cold race might just sip sports drink and be fine with the lower end. The ultimate goal is to **finish the marathon well-hydrated but not over-hydrated**, avoiding both dehydration (which hampers performance and can cause heat illness) and hyponatremia (which can cause severe illness) ([
            Nutrition and Supplement Update for the Endurance Athlete: Review and Recommendations - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6628334/#:~:text=match%20at%20L737%20illustrated%20in,40)). By including electrolytes, runners maintain better **performance** (since cardiovascular function and muscle contraction remain optimal) and safety. 

### Other Micronutrients to Note  
- **Calcium & Vitamin D:** Important for bone density and muscle function. Marathoners subject their bones to repetitive stress; adequate calcium (1000 mg/day for adults, higher for teens/masters) and vitamin D (~800–2000 IU/day if levels are low) help prevent stress fractures and support muscle contractions. Female athletes with menstrual irregularities (relative energy deficiency) are at high risk for low bone density – they absolutely need sufficient calcium and D ([
            Exploring the Relationship between Micronutrients and Athletic Performance: A Comprehensive Scientific Systematic Review of the Literature in Sports Medicine - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10302780/#:~:text=Calcium%20plays%20a%20crucial%20role,63)). Dairy products (milk, yogurt), fortified plant milks, leafy greens, and almonds are good calcium sources. Sun exposure and/or supplements help maintain vitamin D, which in turn aids calcium absorption and muscle recovery. 
- **Zinc:** Involved in energy production and immune function. Endurance exercise can deplete zinc; deficiency in zinc can reduce endurance and impair recovery ([Iron, Zinc and Magnesium Nutrition and Athletic Performance | Sports Medicine
        ](https://link.springer.com/article/10.2165/00007256-198805030-00004#:~:text=Evidence%20is%20presented%20that%20both,are%20used%2C%20it%20is%20important)) ([
            Exploring the Relationship between Micronutrients and Athletic Performance: A Comprehensive Scientific Systematic Review of the Literature in Sports Medicine - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10302780/#:~:text=,40)). Most athletes get enough through meat, seafood, whole grains, and nuts. If a runner has frequent illnesses or poor healing, zinc status might be worth checking. The RDA is ~8–11 mg/day. Caution with oversupplementing (excess zinc can cause copper deficiency). 
- **B-Vitamins:** These vitamins (B1, B2, B3, B6, B12, folate, etc.) are cofactors in energy metabolism pathways and red blood cell production. Marathoners have higher needs for B-vitamins due to their elevated energy turnover. Vitamin B12 and folate are particularly important for red blood cell synthesis (like iron). Vegetarians should ensure B12 intake via fortified foods or a supplement since B12 is only in animal products. Generally, a balanced diet with whole grains, vegetables, and lean proteins provides B-vitamins; a daily multivitamin is an option if diet is limited. Inadequate B-vitamin status can reduce the body’s ability to produce energy and carry oxygen, so it’s wise to meet 100% of daily needs ([16.5: Sports Nutrition - Medicine LibreTexts](https://med.libretexts.org/Under_Construction/Purgatory/Book%3A_Human_Nutrition_1e_(University_of_Hawaii)/16%3A_Performance_Nutrition/16.05%3A_Sports_Nutrition#:~:text=16.5%3A%20Sports%20Nutrition%20,are%20needed%20in%20great%20amounts)). 
- **Antioxidants:** Vitamins C and E, beta-carotene, and selenium are antioxidants that help combat exercise-induced oxidative stress. Marathon training generates free radicals that can contribute to muscle soreness and inflammation. A diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and nuts usually provides ample antioxidants to support recovery. For example, berries (vitamin C), almonds (vitamin E), and tomatoes or carrots (beta-carotene) are all beneficial. High-dose antioxidant supplements are **not** recommended during training – research shows that mega-doses of C or E can blunt some training adaptations by interfering with the body’s natural oxidative signals ([
            Nutrition and Supplement Update for the Endurance Athlete: Review and Recommendations - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6628334/#:~:text=In%20reality%20there%20are%20numerous,injured%20athletes%20and%20are%20steadily)). Thus, **food first** is the mantra: eat colorful produce to get a natural mix of antioxidants. This will support the immune system (important for marathoners under heavy training stress) and aid in repair without negating training gains. 

In summary, micronutrient adequacy is a cornerstone of a marathoner’s nutrition plan. Elites often work with dietitians to ensure things like iron and vitamin D are monitored and optimized, giving them a performance edge. Recreational runners should likewise pay attention to these “small” nutrients – getting blood work if possible, taking a multivitamin or specific supplements if a true deficiency is present (e.g. iron or vitamin D), and otherwise focusing on a nutrient-dense diet. A well-rounded daily diet – high in vegetables, fruits, whole grains, lean proteins, and dairy or fortified alternatives – will naturally cover most micronutrient needs and keep the marathoner’s body functioning at its best.

## Evidence-Based Supplements for Endurance Performance  

Beyond whole foods and standard nutrients, certain **ergogenic aids** (performance-enhancing supplements) have strong scientific support for use in endurance sports like marathoning. Here we detail several supplements with evidence-based benefits: **caffeine, creatine, electrolytes (sodium supplementation), beta-alanine, and nitrates (beetroot juice)**. These have been researched extensively and, when used appropriately, can provide a competitive edge or assist in meeting nutrition needs. It’s important to note that individual responses vary, and supplements should be tested in training before race day. Also, supplements *supplement* a good diet – they don’t compensate for poor eating. Both elite and recreational runners use these aids, though access and acceptance may vary (e.g. nearly all elite marathoners strategically use caffeine, while a recreational runner might or might not). We will describe each and highlight any differences in how elites vs. recreational runners might approach them.

### Caffeine  
**How It Works:** Caffeine is one of the most well-proven performance enhancers in endurance sports. It is a stimulant that affects the central nervous system and muscles. By blocking adenosine receptors in the brain, caffeine reduces the perception of effort and fatigue, allowing a runner to maintain a hard pace longer before feeling exhausted ([
            Nutrition and Supplement Update for the Endurance Athlete: Review and Recommendations - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6628334/#:~:text=Caffeine%2C%20a%20popular%20supplement%20in,and%20increases%20thermogenesis)) ([
            Nutrition and Supplement Update for the Endurance Athlete: Review and Recommendations - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6628334/#:~:text=,a%20greater%20ergogenic%20effect%20than)). It also increases the release of adrenaline, which can improve alertness and perhaps stimulate a greater release of fatty acids from fat stores (theory being it might *spare glycogen* slightly, although its glycogen-sparing effect is minor at marathon intensities). Caffeine can also directly enhance muscle fiber recruitment and calcium release in muscle cells, improving muscle contractility ([
            Nutrition and Supplement Update for the Endurance Athlete: Review and Recommendations - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6628334/#:~:text=acts%20as%20a%20stimulant%20to,This%20dosing%20can%20improve)) ([
            Nutrition and Supplement Update for the Endurance Athlete: Review and Recommendations - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6628334/#:~:text=%CE%B2,practical%20importance%20is%20the%20synergistic)). The net result is improved endurance performance – typically seen as the ability to sustain a given speed longer or to finish a time trial faster. Countless studies and meta-analyses confirm that moderate doses of caffeine increase time-to-exhaustion and reduce race times in events from 5K up to marathon. 

**Usage Guidelines:** The consensus dose for performance enhancement is **3–6 mg of caffeine per kg body weight**, taken about **30–90 minutes before** exercise ([
            Nutrition and Supplement Update for the Endurance Athlete: Review and Recommendations - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6628334/#:~:text=,a%20greater%20ergogenic%20effect%20than)). For a 70 kg runner, this is roughly 210–420 mg of caffeine – equivalent to about 2–4 cups of brewed coffee, or a couple of caffeine pills. Taking caffeine about an hour pre-race allows blood levels to peak during the marathon. Many runners consume caffeine via coffee (for example, an elite might have a strong cup of coffee ~60 min before the gun) or via specialized products (caffeine tablets or caffeinated gels). It’s wise to **start at the low end** (3 mg/kg) and see if that provides a benefit without side effects. Research shows little additional benefit beyond 5-6 mg/kg; higher doses just increase risk of jitters and GI upset ([
            Nutrition and Supplement Update for the Endurance Athlete: Review and Recommendations - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6628334/#:~:text=Higher%20caffeine%20doses%20of%209,considered%20above%20the%20doping%20threshold)). In fact, doses above ~9 mg/kg can produce *negative* effects (anxiety, nausea, heart palpitations, insomnia) with no further performance gain ([
            Nutrition and Supplement Update for the Endurance Athlete: Review and Recommendations - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6628334/#:~:text=Higher%20caffeine%20doses%20of%209,considered%20above%20the%20doping%20threshold)). Most guidelines cap caffeine at ~400-450 mg total for safety and diminishing returns. For context, 3 mg/kg for a 60 kg recreational runner is ~180 mg (the amount in a large cup of coffee or a caffeine gel plus cola during race). **Lower doses (1–2 mg/kg)** can also be beneficial for those sensitive to caffeine – even ~100 mg caffeine (equivalent to an espresso or caffeinated gel) has shown to improve alertness and performance in studies ([
            Nutrition and Supplement Update for the Endurance Athlete: Review and Recommendations - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6628334/#:~:text=complications%20such%20as%20water,77)). 

**During the Race:** In marathons, some runners take additional caffeine during the race to maintain its effects, especially toward the later miles. Caffeine has a half-life of ~5 hours, so a pre-race dose usually covers a marathon duration for elites. Recreational runners out there for 4+ hours might consider a “caffeine top-up” mid-race – e.g. ~50–100 mg around 20 km (perhaps via a caffeinated energy gel or drink). Studies have found that a mid-ride low dose of caffeine (~1.5–3 mg/kg at the 80-minute mark) helped cyclists in the second half of a ~3 hour effort ([
            Nutrition and Supplement Update for the Endurance Athlete: Review and Recommendations - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6628334/#:~:text=Furthermore%2C%20caffeine%20may%20also%20be,trial)). Thus, a runner could consume, say, 100 mg at mile 15–18 to sharpen focus and push through fatigue. One must be cautious not to overdo total intake, and again, test in training (some people get stomach issues if they take caffeine on an empty stomach or while already straining). Caffeine gum or strips that dissolve in the mouth are quick ways some athletes dose late in a race because they absorb faster buccally (through cheek membranes).

**Performance Benefits:** Caffeine reliably offers a modest but significant boost. It can improve **time-trial performance and endurance capacity** – for example, one meta-analysis found ~2–4% improvement in endurance time with caffeine ([
            Nutrition and Supplement Update for the Endurance Athlete: Review and Recommendations - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6628334/#:~:text=,a%20greater%20ergogenic%20effect%20than)). That could translate to knocking several minutes off a marathon for a mid-pack runner or giving an elite the extra edge to dip under a barrier. It also enhances mental alertness, which helps with race concentration and pacing. Interestingly, when taken with carbohydrates, caffeine has a synergistic effect: co-ingesting caffeine plus carbs during exercise improves performance more than carbs alone ([
            Nutrition and Supplement Update for the Endurance Athlete: Review and Recommendations - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6628334/#:~:text=30%E2%80%9390%20min%20prior%20to%20exercise,authors%20question%20if%20practically%20this)). Marathoners often benefit from this synergy by using caffeinated sports gels or drinks (providing both fuel and stimulant together). 

**Individual Differences:** People vary in caffeine sensitivity. Genetic factors (like variations in the CYP1A2 enzyme or adenosine receptor genes) can make some individuals “fast” or “slow” metabolizers, affecting how strongly caffeine works or if it causes jitters. About 10–15% of people feel no performance benefit from caffeine (“non-responders”). Most, however, do benefit. Habitual caffeine users (daily coffee drinkers) still get performance gains, though there was debate on whether one should abstain for a few days prior to an event to “reset” sensitivity. Current evidence suggests that even if you regularly consume caffeine, an acute dose pre-exercise will help – you don’t need to withdraw and suffer through a caffeine headache in race week ([
            Nutrition and Supplement Update for the Endurance Athlete: Review and Recommendations - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6628334/#:~:text=Traditionally%2C%20there%20has%20been%20a,trial%20performance%20to%20an%20acute)) ([
            Nutrition and Supplement Update for the Endurance Athlete: Review and Recommendations - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6628334/#:~:text=trial%20performance%20,102)). That said, extremely high habitual intake might blunt the effect slightly over time. 

**Side Notes and Caution:** Caffeine was once on the Olympic banned list above a certain urine concentration, but it is no longer banned (though *very* high doses could still flag doping tests or disqualify in NCAA sports). Standard marathon use is well below any dangerous level. Key cautions: too much caffeine can cause **GI distress**, which is the last thing a runner wants mid-race. It’s a diuretic in large doses at rest, but during exercise caffeine does not notably dehydrate you – studies show it doesn’t cause excessive urine output while running ([
            Nutrition and Supplement Update for the Endurance Athlete: Review and Recommendations - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6628334/#:~:text=,endurance%20cycling%20and%20running%20research)). Still, chasing caffeine with water or sports drink is wise. Also, if taken late in the day (for an afternoon race), it might disrupt sleep afterwards. For an early morning marathon this isn’t a concern (you’ll be done before noon). 

**Elite vs Recreational Use:** Virtually all elite marathoners leverage caffeine – either through coffee, tea, or pharmacological sources. It’s part of their race routine. Recreational runners can equally benefit: something as simple as an energy gel with 50 mg caffeine at mile 20 can subjectively “give a boost” when hitting the wall. Elites have fine-tuned dosing (e.g. some will take 200–300 mg before the race and maybe another 100 mg late-race if needed). Recreational runners should at least consider using caffeine unless they know they’re very sensitive to it. It’s inexpensive, legal, and effective. As one review succinctly put it, **3–6 mg/kg caffeine ~1 hour pre-exercise improves endurance performance** and vigilance ([
            Nutrition and Supplement Update for the Endurance Athlete: Review and Recommendations - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6628334/#:~:text=,a%20greater%20ergogenic%20effect%20than)). Just avoid going overboard – more is not better beyond a point ([
            Nutrition and Supplement Update for the Endurance Athlete: Review and Recommendations - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6628334/#:~:text=Higher%20caffeine%20doses%20of%209,considered%20above%20the%20doping%20threshold)). With sensible use, caffeine is a proven friend to the marathoner, taking a little of the sting out of those 26.2 miles.

### Creatine  
**What It Is:** Creatine monohydrate is a well-known supplement mostly associated with strength and power sports. It works by increasing the stores of phosphocreatine in muscles, which helps rapidly regenerate ATP (energy currency) during short, intense efforts. At first glance, creatine might not seem relevant to marathoning, a predominantly aerobic endurance event. However, emerging research shows that creatine can have *indirect* benefits for endurance athletes as well – particularly by improving high-intensity efforts within endurance races (like surges or sprint finishes) and by aiding recovery and muscle glycogen storage.

**Mechanisms for Endurance:** When an endurance athlete supplements with creatine, they typically increase muscle creatine and phosphocreatine content by ~15–20%. This doesn’t directly make one run longer on its own, but it can enhance the capacity for **repeated high-intensity bursts**. In a marathon, this might come into play during hill surges, passing moves, or the final kick to the finish. A narrative review in 2023 noted that creatine mostly helps endurance performances that require **multiple surges in intensity or a strong end spurt**, which are indeed *race-defining moments* in competitive events ([
            Creatine supplementation and endurance performance: surges and sprints to win the race - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10132248/#:~:text=effects%2C%20particularly%20in%20weight,mixed%3B%20however%2C%20creatine%20supplementation%20appears)). Essentially, if a marathon involves a tactical burst (as in elite competitions) or if the runner wants the ability to kick hard at the end of 26 miles, creatine could be beneficial. Moreover, creatine supplementation has been found to **increase time to exhaustion during high-intensity endurance** activities by boosting the anaerobic work capacity ([
            Creatine supplementation and endurance performance: surges and sprints to win the race - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10132248/#:~:text=effects%2C%20particularly%20in%20weight,mixed%3B%20however%2C%20creatine%20supplementation%20appears)). So in a long run that has intermittent faster segments, creatine-loaded muscles might fatigue less quickly during those intense segments.

Another benefit of creatine for endurance athletes is its effect on **glycogen**. When creatine is taken along with a high-carbohydrate diet, it has been shown to enhance glycogen storage in muscle ([
            Creatine supplementation and endurance performance: surges and sprints to win the race - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10132248/#:~:text=co,In%20contrast%2C%20creatine)). One mechanism is that creatine, by pulling water into muscle cells, can indirectly signal for greater glycogen synthesis. Studies have demonstrated that creatine loading (e.g. 5 days of 20 g/day) can increase muscle glycogen content more than carbs alone ([
            Creatine supplementation and endurance performance: surges and sprints to win the race - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10132248/#:~:text=Creatine%20supplementation%20also%20facilitates%20the,cycled%20to%20exhaustion%20at%2070)) ([
            Creatine supplementation and endurance performance: surges and sprints to win the race - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10132248/#:~:text=synthase%2C%20or%20glycogenin,had%2018%20elite%20cyclists%20ingest)). Glycogen, of course, is the endurance athlete’s primary fuel. So a marathoner using creatine during carb-loading might end up with “super-compensated” glycogen stores – potentially an edge in energy availability. Creatine also appears to **lower inflammation and oxidative stress** following exhaustive exercise ([
            Creatine supplementation and endurance performance: surges and sprints to win the race - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10132248/#:~:text=co,In%20contrast%2C%20creatine)), which could improve recovery between hard training sessions. There’s even some evidence it might enhance mitochondrial biogenesis (the creation of new mitochondria) in the long term ([
            Creatine supplementation and endurance performance: surges and sprints to win the race - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10132248/#:~:text=nuances%20within%20the%20literature,bearing%20activities.%20Overall%2C%20creatine)), though that’s still being studied. 

**The Downside – Weight Gain:** The main concern with creatine for runners is that it typically causes a small increase in body mass, on the order of 1–2 kg (2–5 lbs), mainly due to increased water retention in muscles. In weight-bearing endurance sports, extra mass can be a disadvantage because it raises the energy cost of running. For an elite vying for every second, adding even 1 kg might slow their pace slightly on uphills or increase impact forces. This is likely why creatine is not universally used by all marathoners. However, some of that initial weight gain can be mitigated by timing (e.g. loading creatine early in a training cycle, then tapering off before race day if weight is an issue). And the benefits might outweigh the weight cost if the runner significantly improves their finishing kick or recovery. A review concluded that while creatine’s weight gain could **offset** some benefits in weight-bearing activities, the **net effect can still be positive** if it allows for higher quality training or better surges ([
            Creatine supplementation and endurance performance: surges and sprints to win the race - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10132248/#:~:text=content%2C%20an%20important%20fuel%20to,that%20require%20multiple%20surges%20in)). 

**Usage and Protocol:** The standard way to take creatine is either a **loading phase** (20 g/day split into 4 doses for 5–7 days, then 3–5 g/day maintenance) or simply a daily low dose (5 g/day for ~4 weeks to reach saturation). Either achieves full muscle creatine stores. For endurance athletes, a more gradual approach (3–5 g/day) may avoid sudden weight gain and GI discomfort. Many will cycle it: e.g. use it in heavy training blocks to help with cross-training or interval workouts, then possibly stop a week or two before racing if concerned about weight (creatine’s benefits on muscle don’t immediately vanish, and stopping can shed a bit of water weight). 

**Performance Evidence:** Direct studies on creatine and marathon performance are limited. However, in sports like cycling, creatine has helped in scenarios like a sprint after prolonged cycling. One analysis notes **mixed results on time-trial performance** – some studies show no improvement in pure steady-state endurance, which makes sense ([
            Creatine supplementation and endurance performance: surges and sprints to win the race - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10132248/#:~:text=effects%2C%20particularly%20in%20weight,mixed%3B%20however%2C%20creatine%20supplementation%20appears)). But importantly, **creatine appears more effective for performance when explosive efforts are required during endurance exercise** ([
            Creatine supplementation and endurance performance: surges and sprints to win the race - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10132248/#:~:text=effects%2C%20particularly%20in%20weight,mixed%3B%20however%2C%20creatine%20supplementation%20appears)). It can also increase the quality of interval training sessions (by allowing slightly higher power output or more repetitions before fatigue). Over weeks, that could translate to better fitness gains. Creatine’s recovery benefits (less muscle damage, etc.) mean an athlete might handle higher training loads – indirectly boosting endurance. 

For recreational runners, creatine might help if they also engage in gym training or high-intensity interval runs as part of their program, by improving those workouts. For older runners (masters athletes), creatine can help counter age-related muscle loss and improve training adaptations, which may indirectly aid endurance capacity. Additionally, creatine has cognitive benefits (improved memory and possibly reduced mental fatigue), which could be a minor bonus in long races. 

**Bottom Line:** Creatine is a **safe, well-researched supplement** that could offer marathoners benefits in glycogen storage, high-intensity bursts, and recovery ([
            Creatine supplementation and endurance performance: surges and sprints to win the race - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10132248/#:~:text=nuances%20within%20the%20literature,intensity%20endurance)) ([
            Creatine supplementation and endurance performance: surges and sprints to win the race - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10132248/#:~:text=effects%2C%20particularly%20in%20weight,mixed%3B%20however%2C%20creatine%20supplementation%20appears)). The trade-off is potential water-weight gain. Many elite marathoners do not use creatine routinely, but some do – especially those who incorporate a lot of speedwork or have track racing seasons as well. Recreational runners might try creatine during training to see how their body responds. If they find their weight stays stable and they feel stronger in workouts, it could be kept in their regimen. If they bloat or feel heavy, they might drop it pre-race. **Creatine does not directly make you run faster for 26 miles**, but by allowing you to *train* a bit harder and perhaps finish stronger, it can indirectly improve marathon performance. As one paper summarized: *“Overall, creatine supplementation increases time to exhaustion during high-intensity endurance activities... and appears to be more effective at improving performances that require multiple surges in intensity and/or end spurts.”* ([
            Creatine supplementation and endurance performance: surges and sprints to win the race - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10132248/#:~:text=effects%2C%20particularly%20in%20weight,mixed%3B%20however%2C%20creatine%20supplementation%20appears)). This suggests it’s more of a tool for well-trained runners looking for that extra edge in specific aspects of their race or training.

### Electrolytes (Salt Supplementation)  
*Note:* We’ve covered electrolytes in the micronutrient section, but it’s worth reiterating here as a “supplement” strategy because taking electrolyte products (salt tablets, sports drinks, etc.) during races is a form of supplementation crucial for performance and safety. 

**Why:** During a marathon, especially in warm conditions, **sodium loss** can be substantial. Supplementing electrolytes is evidence-based to prevent hyponatremia and maintain performance in events over ~2 hours ([
            Nutrition and Supplement Update for the Endurance Athlete: Review and Recommendations - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6628334/#:~:text=environmental%20conditions,and%20the%20average%20sodium)). The **ACSM and other sports bodies recommend** that athletes consume fluids with sodium during prolonged exercise to replace at least part of what is lost ([
            Nutrition and Supplement Update for the Endurance Athlete: Review and Recommendations - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6628334/#:~:text=environmental%20conditions,and%20the%20average%20sodium)). This is not about performance enhancement in the sense of making you faster than normal; rather, it’s about preventing decline in performance due to dehydration or electrolyte imbalances. In a way, electrolyte supplementation is a necessary component of an optimal marathon fueling plan, just as carbs are.

**How:** As mentioned, aiming for about **300–600 mg sodium per hour** is a general guideline ([
            Nutrition and Supplement Update for the Endurance Athlete: Review and Recommendations - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6628334/#:~:text=match%20at%20L726%20commercial%20sports,discussed%20in%20Recovery%20Nutrition%20section)), which typically means drinking a sports beverage or using electrolyte capsules. Most marathon-oriented sports drinks provide sodium (e.g. Gatorade ~450 mg/L, or ~110 mg per 8 oz cup). If a runner drinks ~16 oz (0.5 L) per hour of such sports drink, that’s ~220–250 mg sodium/hour – often on the low side for heavy sweaters. Hence, many will consume more, or use saltier drinks (some formulations have 700+ mg per liter), or add salt tabs. Salt tablets often contain ~200–300 mg sodium each; a runner might take one every 30–60 minutes along with water if they are using mostly plain water for hydration. The goal is to keep sodium intake roughly proportionate to sweat losses to maintain blood sodium levels. Athletes who know their sweat rate and composition can customize this (some get sweat tests done). As an example, an elite who loses 2 L/hour of sweat with ~1 g/L sodium but only drinks 1 L/hour of fluid is net losing ~1 g sodium per hour; over a 2-hour race that’s 2 g. They might ensure their drink carries at least ~500 mg/L, giving 500 mg/h intake, and finish slightly hypo-hydrated but okay. A recreational runner sweating 1 L/h for 4 hours, if they drink 1 L/h of pure water (0 sodium), will lose ~4 g sodium without replacement – risking hyponatremia. If instead they drink sports drink giving 400 mg/h and perhaps eat some salty pretzels or gel with sodium for another 200 mg/h, they net replace ~1500–2000 mg of the ~4000 mg lost, which can keep blood sodium in safe range (the body can tolerate some deficit).

**Effects on Performance:** Proper electrolyte and fluid balance helps maintain **cardiac output, thermoregulation, and muscle function**. Even mild dehydration (>2% body weight loss) can impair performance, and significant sodium loss can contribute to muscle cramps (though cramping is multifactorial). By supplementing sodium, runners better retain fluid and stimulate thirst appropriately, which can prevent excessive dehydration. It’s well documented that a dehydrated athlete experiences higher heart rate and perceived exertion for the same pace. Thus, staying on top of hydration/electrolytes allows a marathoner to sustain their goal pace more comfortably, especially in later miles. Furthermore, avoiding hyponatremia is critical – severe hyponatremia can cause confusion, collapse, or worse. Marathon history has examples of recreational runners collapsing near the finish not from lack of energy, but from electrolyte imbalance. So think of electrolyte supplements as **performance protection**.

**Products and Choices:** Common electrolyte supplements include sports drinks (e.g. Gatorade Endurance, Nuun tablets dissolved in water, Tailwind, etc.), electrolyte gels (some energy gels are higher in sodium), salt sticks/capsules, or even homemade mixes. Some runners like pickle juice or bouillon in ultras – those are high in sodium and have anecdotal support for cramp relief. In a standard marathon, sticking to sports drink at aid stations is usually sufficient for most runners. However, those who don’t like the provided drink might carry their own electrolyte concentrate. Elite marathoners have personal bottles and often formulate a precise mix of carbs and electrolytes to meet their needs (for example, adding extra sodium for a hot race). Recreational runners should simply be mindful: **drink something with electrolytes regularly during the race, rather than plain water alone** ([
            Nutrition and Supplement Update for the Endurance Athlete: Review and Recommendations - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6628334/#:~:text=environmental%20conditions,and%20the%20average%20sodium)).

**Preloading:** One strategy for hot conditions is pre-race electrolyte loading. For instance, drinking a high-sodium beverage (~~700 mg sodium in 500 mL fluid) about 90 minutes before the start can expand plasma volume a bit, giving the body a larger reservoir of fluids to draw from ([Contemporary Nutrition Strategies to Optimize Performance in Distance Runners and Race Walkers - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30747558/#:~:text=nutrition%20plan%20should%20balance%20the,based%20performance%20supplements)). Some products (like glycerol-containing solutions) were used in the past for hyperhydration; glycerol is now banned, but sodium loading is allowed and effective. The IOC consensus notes that in hot environments, a combination of pre-race *hyperhydration* with sodium and *cooling* (like ice vests) can provide a small benefit ([Contemporary Nutrition Strategies to Optimize Performance in Distance Runners and Race Walkers - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30747558/#:~:text=amounts%20sufficient%20for%20event%20fuel,thermal%20challenge%20and%20fluid%20deficit)). Recreational runners can mimic this by eating a salted meal or sports drink before the race. 

**Post-Race:** After finishing, rehydration with electrolytes is crucial for recovery. A general guideline is to consume about 1.2–1.5 L of fluid for each kg of body mass lost, with sufficient sodium to retain that fluid (e.g. via recovery drinks, soups, or salted foods). This ensures proper rehydration and can speed recovery by restoring normal blood volume.

In summary, **electrolyte supplementation (especially sodium)** during a marathon is strongly evidence-supported and practically recommended ([
            Nutrition and Supplement Update for the Endurance Athlete: Review and Recommendations - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6628334/#:~:text=environmental%20conditions,and%20the%20average%20sodium)). It is one of the “secrets” to avoiding hitting the wall due not to fuel, but to hydration collapse. All marathoners, elite or not, should incorporate sodium into their race nutrition plan. The difference is often just execution: elites have it measured out in personal bottles, while recreational runners might rely on sports drink at aid stations or carry salt caps if needed. Getting this right can be the difference between a smooth last 10K and a struggle with cramps or dizziness. It’s not a flashy ergogenic aid, but it’s a **vital one** for endurance performance.

### Beta-Alanine  
**What It Is:** Beta-alanine is a non-essential amino acid that, when ingested, helps raise levels of *carnosine* in muscle. Carnosine is an important intracellular buffer – it soaks up hydrogen ions (H+) that are produced during high-intensity exercise. By buffering H+, carnosine delays the drop in muscle pH (acidosis) that contributes to fatigue. Beta-alanine supplementation is well-known to improve performance in high-intensity exercise bouts lasting ~1 to 10 minutes, such as 800m to 1500m runs or rowing events ([
            Beta-Alanine Supplementation Improved 10-km Running Time Trial in Physically Active Adults - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6092497/#:~:text=A%20meta,and%20the%20majority%20of%20these)). Its relevance to a marathon is less direct, since a marathon is usually run below the lactate threshold (you’re not accumulating huge lactate and H+ until maybe the very end or during surges). However, there are potential benefits in long-duration events that include varying intensities or in individuals who tend to accumulate lactate at marathon race pace (for instance, less trained runners who run at a higher relative intensity).

**Evidence for Endurance:** The evidence for beta-alanine in events beyond 30 minutes is mixed and still emerging. The **majority of beta-alanine studies** show efficacy in efforts of 1–4 minutes (high lactate scenarios) ([
            Beta-Alanine Supplementation Improved 10-km Running Time Trial in Physically Active Adults - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6092497/#:~:text=A%20meta,and%20the%20majority%20of%20these)). For continuous exercises longer than 25–30 min, results have been inconsistent ([
            Beta-Alanine Supplementation Improved 10-km Running Time Trial in Physically Active Adults - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6092497/#:~:text=and%20intramuscular%20H%2B%20accumulation,on%20performance%20beyond%2025%20min)). That said, a few studies have hinted at benefits: one study found beta-alanine improved a 10 km running time trial (which took ~1 hour for subjects) and was associated with lower lactate concentrations afterward ([
            Beta-Alanine Supplementation Improved 10-km Running Time Trial in Physically Active Adults - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6092497/#:~:text=To%20our%20knowledge%2C%20this%20was,supplementation%2C%20with%20lower%20lactate%20concentration)) ([
            Beta-Alanine Supplementation Improved 10-km Running Time Trial in Physically Active Adults - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6092497/#:~:text=showing%20an%20association%20between%20lower,to%20lower%20blood%20lactate%20accumulation)). This suggests beta-alanine might help runners clear or utilize lactate better even in a prolonged effort, thereby slightly improving performance. Another angle: beta-alanine could aid during parts of a marathon where intensity spikes – for example, climbing a hill or a finishing kick, where localized acidosis in fast-twitch fibers could otherwise force a slowdown. By buffering that, the athlete might sustain the effort a bit longer.

A meta-analysis noted that beta-alanine had **small but significant performance effects in high-intensity sustained events, with an average 2–3% improvement in recreational athletes, and ~0.5–1% in elite athletes** ([
	An update on beta-alanine supplementation for athletes
](http://www.gssiweb.org/sports-science-exchange/article/an-update-on-beta-alanine-supplementation-for-athletes#:~:text=%2A%20Two%20meta,1.0%25%20in%20elite%20athletes)). This indicates two things: (1) any performance gain is modest (not game-changing like carbs or caffeine, but potentially the difference of 30–90 seconds in a marathon for a recreational runner), and (2) less trained individuals seem to benefit more, likely because elites are already very well adapted (higher muscle carnosine from training and diet) ([
	An update on beta-alanine supplementation for athletes
](http://www.gssiweb.org/sports-science-exchange/article/an-update-on-beta-alanine-supplementation-for-athletes#:~:text=%2A%20Two%20meta,1.0%25%20in%20elite%20athletes)). Indeed, well-trained athletes may naturally have higher baseline carnosine in muscle, so supplementing gives them a smaller relative boost.

For marathoners, beta-alanine might be more attractive to those who also do shorter races or a lot of tempo/speed training, as it can improve those sessions. If a recreational marathoner also runs 5Ks or 10Ks, beta-alanine could help across their racing profile. For an elite purely focused on marathons, it’s a bit more debatable – some elites do use beta-alanine (especially if they anticipate surges in pace or just want any small edge). Since beta-alanine is not expensive and is safe (aside from harmless tingling skin sensations called paresthesia when dosing, which can be managed by splitting doses), some marathoners take it as “insurance” for those hard parts of the race. 

**How to Use:** Beta-alanine must be taken consistently over time to load muscles with carnosine. A typical regimen is **4–6 grams of beta-alanine per day, split into 2–3 doses, for at least 4–6 weeks**. This can raise muscle carnosine by ~40-80%. After loading, a maintenance dose of ~1.5–2 g/day can sustain levels. Benefits generally kick in after a few weeks once carnosine is elevated. So this is not an acute supplement you take on race morning (it doesn’t work that way). It’s more akin to creatine – a chronic loading supplement. Many athletes will do a 2-month beta-alanine cycle leading up to their competitive season. 

**Performance Outcomes:** With effective loading, beta-alanine can **increase endurance capacity** in efforts near the lactate threshold. Some studies show it delays fatigue by allowing a higher threshold of H+ accumulation. In a marathon, if a runner in the final 10K is flirting with lactate buildup (as they fatigue, even marathon pace can start generating more lactate due to muscle fiber recruitment changes), having higher muscle carnosine might stave off that dreaded heavy-leg feeling for a bit longer. Additionally, marathons often involve **sprinting at the finish** – whether an elite kicking for a win, or a recreational runner trying to beat a time goal in the final straight. Beta-alanine could make that sprint finish more effective by buffering the rapid acid production in those fast-twitch fibers.

**Research summary:** It’s fair to say beta-alanine is **less crucial** to marathon performance than carbohydrates or caffeine, but it is supported by enough evidence in endurance contexts to be considered. The International Society of Sports Nutrition classifies beta-alanine as a Group A supplement (strong evidence for specific performance benefits). The magnitude of effect is generally *small*, but for serious athletes small improvements count. Recreational runners might see a slightly bigger bump (2–3% better high-intensity performance) than elites (~1%), as noted in meta-analysis ([

](http://www.gssiweb.org/sports-science-exchange/article/an-update-on-beta-alanine-supplementation-for-athletes#:~:text=%2A%20Two%20meta,1.0%25%20in%20elite%20athletes)). Over 26 miles, even 1% improvement is ~2–3 minutes for a 3:30 marathoner – potentially meaningful. Moreover, beta-alanine has additive effects with other buffers like sodium bicarbonate (though bicarb is hard to use in a marathon due to GI side effects).

**Considerations:** Beta-alanine is very safe. The main side effect, a tingling sensation (paresthesia), occurs if one takes a large dose (like >800–1000 mg at once). This can be mitigated by using sustained-release formulations or taking smaller doses throughout the day. Some users find this tingle unpleasant, others don’t mind. It fades as the body adapts. If a runner tries beta-alanine, they should start at maybe 1.6 g twice a day and build up, taking with meals if needed. 

**Elite vs Recreational Use:** Many elite mid-distance runners use beta-alanine; some marathoners at the pro level may or may not – it’s not as ubiquitous as caffeine. Recreational athletes who have performance goals and are already nailing the basics (diet, training, hydration) could consider it for an extra edge. If someone is purely running for completion or fun, beta-alanine is likely unnecessary. But for those chasing a PR, it could be part of the supplement regimen. It’s worth noting that beta-alanine is not an overnight miracle – the athlete needs to commit to a regimen well before the race. If a runner cannot be consistent with pills or powders for weeks, this might not be for them.

In conclusion, **beta-alanine supplementation can increase muscle buffering capacity, which is beneficial primarily for high-intensity exercise bouts**. Its direct impact on a marathon is subtle, but it might help during intensive segments and contribute to overall endurance by reducing lactate accumulation ([

Therefore, it’s an option in the toolkit for marathoners seeking comprehensive gains. As always, test it in training – see if you notice improvements in tempo runs or shorter races after a month on beta-alanine. If yes, it likely is doing something positive; if not, one might choose to allocate resources elsewhere. 

### Nitrates (Beetroot Juice)  
**What It Is:** Nitrate (NO₃⁻) supplementation, commonly in the form of **beetroot juice** or concentrated beet shots, has emerged in the last decade as a popular endurance ergogenic aid. Nitrates in food (like beetroot, spinach, arugula, celery) are converted in the body to **nitric oxide (NO)**, a signaling molecule that causes blood vessels to dilate and helps regulate muscle efficiency. The discovery that dietary nitrate can enhance exercise performance – notably via a landmark 2009 study with cyclists – led to a surge of research. In endurance sports, nitrate supplementation is shown to **reduce the oxygen cost of submaximal exercise and improve exercise tolerance**, essentially making your muscles more efficient ([
            Nutrition and Supplement Update for the Endurance Athlete: Review and Recommendations - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6628334/#:~:text=inorganic%20nitrate%20%28NO3%E2%88%92%29,32%2C51%20%2C%2073%2C53)). By requiring slightly less O₂ for the same output, an athlete can either go a bit faster for a given effort or sustain a given pace longer before fatigue.

**Benefits for Marathoners:** The primary benefit of nitrates is improved **running economy** – your body uses oxygen more economically. Studies have found that after nitrate supplementation, athletes could exercise at a given workload with ~3-5% less oxygen consumption, and some see improved time-to-exhaustion or time-trial performance ([
            Nutrition and Supplement Update for the Endurance Athlete: Review and Recommendations - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6628334/#:~:text=oxide%20has%20numerous%20bodily%20effects,32%2C51%20%2C%2073%2C53)). For a marathoner, better running economy directly translates to performance: think of it like getting slightly better gas mileage on your aerobic “engine.” If you save some energy throughout the race, you have more left for the latter miles. Research has shown improvements in events ranging from 5 km to 10 km time trials with beetroot juice, especially in moderately trained individuals ([
            Nutrition and Supplement Update for the Endurance Athlete: Review and Recommendations - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6628334/#:~:text=respiration%20and%20biogenesis%2C%20glucose%20uptake%2C,32%2C51%20%2C%2073%2C53)). 

However, results can be mixed. Many studies indicate **non-elite athletes benefit more strongly** than well-trained elites ([
            Nutrition and Supplement Update for the Endurance Athlete: Review and Recommendations - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6628334/#:~:text=can%20improve%20muscle%20economy%2C%20efficiency,12%20%2C%2072%2C52%20%2C%2074)) ([
            Nutrition and Supplement Update for the Endurance Athlete: Review and Recommendations - PMC

Elites often already have high baseline NO and efficiency, possibly diminishing the supplement’s impact. Some studies on highly trained runners or cyclists show minimal or no performance change with nitrates – likely because their engines are already finely tuned and possibly because their diet is already rich in nitrates (e.g., a lot of veggies) ([
            Nutrition and Supplement Update for the Endurance Athlete: Review and Recommendations - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6628334/#:~:text=studies%20are%20on%20subjects%20of,and%20was%20associated%20with%20a)). One review noted nitrate supplementation tends to improve performance “mainly in non-elite athletes” ([
            Nutrition and Supplement Update for the Endurance Athlete: Review and Recommendations - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6628334/#:~:text=can%20improve%20muscle%20economy%2C%20efficiency,elite%20athletes%29%20%5B12%2C51%2C52%2C53)). Nonetheless, even for elites, nitrates can be worthwhile in certain conditions (like when oxygen availability is a limiting factor – e.g., high altitude races, or extremely hot conditions where blood flow is crucial). 

**How to Supplement:** The typical protocol is to ingest a high-nitrate dose about **2–3 hours before exercise** (to allow time for conversion to nitric oxide). For beetroot juice, this is often about **500 mL of beet juice** or a concentrated “shot” (which might be ~70 mL concentrated to provide the same nitrates). This provides on the order of 300–600 mg of nitrate (≈ ~5-10 mmol). Studies have used doses like 6–8 mmol of nitrate (which ~ tends to be standard). Some research suggests multiple days of supplementation can further raise plasma nitrite levels – for instance, drinking beet juice daily for 3 days before an event might yield a slightly bigger effect than a single dose ([
            Nutrition and Supplement Update for the Endurance Athlete: Review and Recommendations - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6628334/#:~:text=nitrate%20intake%20or%20supplementation%20may,target%20healthy%20nitrate%20intake%20levels)). One protocol is ~500 mL beet juice per day for 3 days, including race morning. Another approach is acute: take ~2 shots of concentrated beet ~2 hours pre-race (each shot ~4 mmol nitrate, for total ~8 mmol). 

**Timing Nuances:** There’s been discussion on optimal timing. Traditional advice was ~2.5–3h pre-exercise (since nitrate -> nitrite via oral bacteria takes time, and nitrite -> NO peaks around that time). However, recent data suggest starting a bit closer (90 min before) might be beneficial, to ensure peak NO levels coincide with exercise ([
            Nutrition and Supplement Update for the Endurance Athlete: Review and Recommendations - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6628334/#:~:text=results,suboptimal%20time%20interval%20for%20exercise)). In practice, many athletes drink their beet juice about 90 minutes to 2 hours before the race. Consistency matters too – swishing antibacterial mouthwash can impair nitrate’s effect because it kills oral bacteria needed for conversion (so avoid that around the time). 

**Effects Observed:** Nitrate supplementation can **improve time-trial performance modestly**, for example, shaving ~1-2% off a 5k time in some studies ([
            Nutrition and Supplement Update for the Endurance Athlete: Review and Recommendations - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6628334/#:~:text=respiration%20and%20biogenesis%2C%20glucose%20uptake%2C,32%2C51%20%2C%2073%2C53)). It tends to improve endurance in events lasting 10–40 minutes quite reliably in moderately trained subjects. For longer events like a marathon, the evidence is less direct (fewer studies on actual marathon runs), but logically if you improve economy and threshold a bit, it should help. A concern for very long events is that nitrate’s acute effects might wane after ~6-8 hours, but a marathon is within that range. Multi-day “loading” ensures muscle nitrate stores are up, which might sustain effect through the event ([
            Nutrition and Supplement Update for the Endurance Athlete: Review and Recommendations - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6628334/#:~:text=nitrate%20intake%20or%20supplementation%20may,target%20healthy%20nitrate%20intake%20levels)). 

**Other Benefits:** Nitrate (NO) also increases blood flow to muscles and may improve coupling of oxygen utilization – which could help during a marathon by enhancing fuel delivery to muscles. It might also help mitigate some fatigue processes by improving contractile efficiency. Some athletes report feeling “less exhausted” at a given pace after beet juice.

**Elites vs Recreational Differences:** As noted, **elites often see smaller gains**. Some studies on elite cyclists/runners found no significant improvement (possibly because they were near physiological max, or their diet already high nitrate). Recreational runners, who have more room for efficiency improvement, often do see benefits. For example, one study showed that in trained but not elite cyclists, nitrate improved 10k cycling TT performance by a few percent, whereas in elite cyclists it did little ([
            Nutrition and Supplement Update for the Endurance Athlete: Review and Recommendations - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6628334/#:~:text=cardiorespiratory%20performance%20at%20anaerobic%20threshold%2C,days%20of%20a%20high%20nitrate)). This isn’t universal – some elite athletes are “responders.” Given the low risk, many elites still use beetroot shots as part of their race routine, figuring any tiny advantage helps. Also, elites might benefit in training – some use nitrates to enhance quality of key workouts.

**Dietary Nitrate vs Supplement:** A neat aspect is you can also get nitrates through diet: eating a **high-nitrate diet (lots of spinach, beets, rocket)** for a week can elevate nitrate levels comparably to supplementation ([
            Nutrition and Supplement Update for the Endurance Athlete: Review and Recommendations - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6628334/#:~:text=nitrate%20intake%20or%20supplementation%20may,target%20healthy%20nitrate%20intake%20levels)). So a marathoner could just ensure their pre-race meals are nitrate-rich. However, the concentration in a shot is easier to measure and consume than eating pounds of vegetables. Many just find it convenient to down a beet juice.

**Potential Drawbacks:** Beetroot juice can cause harmless side effects like *beeturia* (pink/red urine) or red stools, which athletes should be aware of so they don’t panic ([
            Nutrition and Supplement Update for the Endurance Athlete: Review and Recommendations - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6628334/#:~:text=experience%20nitrate%20supplements%20may%20become,red%20bowel%20movements%2C%20which%20is)). Also, some people find the taste of beet juice unpleasant or it may cause slight stomach upset (the concentrated shots are strong-tasting). Practicing intake in training can ensure tolerance. Nitrate is generally safe, though extremely high chronic intake might have theoretical risks (like interacting with certain medications or conditions). For healthy athletes, it’s considered safe. 

One interesting caution: mouthwash or chewing gum that kills oral bacteria will blunt the conversion of nitrate to nitrite, so avoid those around the time of consuming nitrates ([
            Nutrition and Supplement Update for the Endurance Athlete: Review and Recommendations - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6628334/#:~:text=studies%2C%20since%20NO%20levels%20peak,race%20can%20have)). Also, because NO can lower blood pressure, individuals with already low BP should be careful. In fact, **nitrates can slightly reduce resting blood pressure** – some see a 5 mmHg drop ([
            Nutrition and Supplement Update for the Endurance Athlete: Review and Recommendations - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6628334/#:~:text=during%20high,target%20healthy%20nitrate%20intake%20levels)) – which for an athlete is usually fine, possibly beneficial. But if someone is hypotensive, they should monitor.

**Conclusion on Nitrates:** Nitrate supplementation (e.g. beetroot juice) is an **evidence-backed strategy to enhance endurance performance by improving efficiency and stamina** ([
            Nutrition and Supplement Update for the Endurance Athlete: Review and Recommendations - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6628334/#:~:text=oxide%20has%20numerous%20bodily%20effects,32%2C51%20%2C%2073%2C53)). It’s particularly effective in recreational athletes and in events where oxygen delivery is a limiting factor. For a marathoner, it can mean needing a bit less oxygen at a given pace, which can delay fatigue. Many athletes treat a beet shot as part of their pre-race nutrition just like a carb load – it has become quite mainstream. Given that it might help more for non-elites, recreational runners stand to gain as much if not more than elites from this. As always, test it out: try a hard long run with and without beet juice and see if you perceive a difference in how hard the effort feels. If it feels easier or your heart rate is slightly lower for the same pace, that’s the nitrate doing its job. 

In summary, **beetroot juice (nitrate) supplementation can make running more efficient and has shown improvements in endurance performance, especially in non-elite runners** ([
            Nutrition and Supplement Update for the Endurance Athlete: Review and Recommendations - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6628334/#:~:text=can%20improve%20muscle%20economy%2C%20efficiency,elite%20athletes%29%20%5B12%2C51%2C52%2C53)). It’s generally used by consuming a high-nitrate dose ~90 minutes before the marathon. Some do a multi-day load leading up. While results vary, the low cost and natural origin (it’s basically concentrated vegetable juice) make it a favorable option. Many marathon runners, from first-timers to Olympians, have “gone purple” with beet juice to gain any edge in the 26.2-mile challenge.

## Ideal Food Examples for Marathon Nutrition  

Translating the science into practice, this section provides **practical food examples** and meal ideas aligning with the nutritional strategies outlined. We will break this down into: **Everyday training diet** (how a marathoner might eat on a regular training day), and **Race-day nutrition** – including specific suggestions for the pre-race meal, during-race fueling, and post-race recovery. These examples cater to both elite-level needs (often just larger quantities) and recreational runners. The principles are the same, but portion sizes and exact choices can be scaled. A focus is on whole-food options that meet macro and micronutrient goals, with mention of convenient sports products where appropriate.

### Everyday Training Diet Examples  
On a typical training day (especially when heavy mileage or key workouts are scheduled), marathoners should consume a **high-carbohydrate, moderate-protein, moderate-fat** diet rich in unprocessed, nutrient-dense foods. Here’s how a day’s meals might look:

- **Breakfast:** A bowl of oatmeal topped with sliced banana and a drizzle of honey, plus a side of Greek yogurt. *(Rationale: Oatmeal and banana provide quality carbs for energy and potassium; honey adds quick carbs. Greek yogurt contributes ~15–20 g protein for muscle repair and calcium for bones.)* For an elite or high-volume trainer, the portion might be large (e.g. 1.5 cups dry oats, 2 bananas, big scoop of yogurt), whereas a recreational runner might have ~1 cup oats, 1 banana, smaller yogurt. This meal yields ~80–120 g carbs (depending on portion) and ~20 g protein – a great start to fuel a morning run.

- **Mid-Morning Snack:** A fruit smoothie made with berries, spinach, a scoop of whey or plant protein, and almond milk. Add a handful of oats or a spoon of peanut butter if extra calories needed. *(Rationale: Smoothies are easy to digest between workouts. Berries and spinach provide vitamins (C, antioxidants, iron from spinach), the protein powder adds ~20 g protein, and a bit of healthy fat from peanut butter can curb hunger. Oats blended in boost carbs.)* For example, a smoothie with 1 cup berries, 1 banana, a cup of spinach, 1 scoop protein, and 8 oz almond milk has ~50 g carbs, 25 g protein, ample micronutrients. This is especially good if an athlete did an AM run and needs to refuel before lunchtime.

- **Lunch:** Grilled chicken (or tofu for vegetarians) sandwich on whole-grain bread with avocado and plenty of veggies (tomato, lettuce); a side of baked sweet potato or pretzels; and perhaps an orange. *(Rationale: Whole-grain bread and sweet potato provide complex carbs and fiber, replenishing glycogen and providing steady energy. The chicken/tofu offers ~25–30 g protein for recovery. Avocado gives healthy fat (and magnesium, potassium), and veggies/fruits add antioxidants and vitamins.)* A specific example: a large sandwich might have ~60 g carbs (bread + condiments + veggies), ~30 g protein (if double chicken breast or thick tofu), ~15 g fat (avocado). Sweet potato adds ~30 g more carbs. This balanced meal supports afternoon training sessions by topping up liver glycogen and nutrients.

- **Afternoon Snack:** Trail mix (nuts and dried fruit) or a couple of energy bars, depending on hunger and schedule. *(Rationale: Nuts (almonds, cashews) provide magnesium, healthy fats, and some protein; dried fruits (raisins, apricots) are rich in iron and quick carbs ([Macronutrient and mineral intake effects on racing time and ...](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0899900720300897#:~:text=,and%20presented%20better%20cardiovascular%20health)). This snack keeps energy levels up and prevents excessive muscle breakdown between meals.)* For example, 1/4 cup of trail mix might have ~15 g carbs, 5 g protein, 10 g fat. If a runner is about to do a second run or gym session, they might opt for an energy bar with ~30 g carbs and ~10 g protein for more immediate fuel.

- **Dinner:** Spaghetti, a side salad, and whole-grain bread. *(Rationale: A classic high-carb meal – pasta is excellent for glycogen (and easy to eat a lot of), lean ground meat or a plant-based alternative adds protein (~20–30 g in a serving) and iron/B12 if red meat is used, and the tomato sauce provides lycopene and extra carbs. A green salad drizzled with olive oil adds fiber, vitamin C (if tomatoes/peppers included) to aid iron absorption, and the bread can mop up extra sauce for more carbs.)* End-of-day carbs help ensure muscle glycogen is filled overnight ([
            Nutrition and Supplement Update for the Endurance Athlete: Review and Recommendations - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6628334/#:~:text=Prior%20to%20the%20race%20,However%20recent)). For an elite, the portion might be two large plates of pasta (~150+ g carbs), whereas a recreational might have a more moderate plate (~75 g carbs). In both cases, this meal is high in carbs to recover from the day and prepare for tomorrow. Olive oil in salad gives healthy fat, and perhaps a glass of milk or fortified almond milk on the side gives calcium and additional protein.

- **Evening Snack (if needed):** Greek yogurt with granola, or cottage cheese with pineapple, or even a small bowl of cereal with milk. *(Rationale: A pre-bed protein (casein from dairy) can support overnight muscle repair; adding some carbs (granola or fruit) keeps glycogen synthesis humming. If weight management is a goal, the athlete might skip a heavy snack; if they’re in heavy training, a 300-400 kcal snack is very justified.)* For instance, 1 cup of Greek yogurt with 1/4 cup granola and some berries might have ~25 g protein, 30 g carbs, beneficial probiotics and fiber.

This sample day hits high carbohydrate (>60% of calories in this example, as marathoners often need ([Runner's Diet | Johns Hopkins Medicine](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/wellness-and-prevention/runners-diet#:~:text=People%20who%20include%20running%20or,of%20their%20calories%20from%20carbohydrates))), adequate protein (~1.5 g/kg or more), and moderate fat (~25–30% calories), plus is rich in micronutrients (fruits, veggies, whole grains, lean meats). It also includes *functional foods* relevant to runners: oats, bananas, and raisins (for carbs and potassium), leafy greens (iron, magnesium), nuts (magnesium, vitamin E), and dairy (calcium, protein). According to Johns Hopkins Medicine, runners should aim for about **60–70% of calories from carbohydrates** in training ([Runner's Diet | Johns Hopkins Medicine](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/wellness-and-prevention/runners-diet#:~:text=People%20who%20include%20running%20or,of%20their%20calories%20from%20carbohydrates)) – the above plan aligns with that, featuring carbs at every meal and snack. The diet also naturally provides key micros: e.g. iron from meat and spinach, calcium from dairy and greens, sodium from breads and any added salt, etc. 

**Elite vs Recreational Quantities:** The difference is mostly in quantity and perhaps number of snacks. Elites burning 3,000-4,000 kcal/day will simply eat larger portions or additional snacks. For example, an elite might double the breakfast oatmeal serving and add more bread at dinner, or have two sandwiches at lunch instead of one. A recreational runner training less might not need the afternoon snack or might have smaller portions of pasta. But qualitatively, the food choices remain appropriate for both – there’s nothing exotic needed for elites besides more food. In fact, research supports a “food first” approach – many whole foods can substitute sports products effectively for fueling and recovery ([

        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10054587/#:~:text=Carbohydrate%20,to%20the%20ingestion%20of%20some)) ([
            Carbohydrates and Endurance Exercise: A Narrative Review of a Food First Approach - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10054587/#:~:text=performance,to%20difficulties%20in%20the%20quantities)). For instance, raisins, bananas, and honey are cited as good carbohydrate sources during exercise, comparable to commercial gels ([

So a recreational runner on a budget can use real foods to fuel: a banana and some raisins during a long run in place of a gel, if it sits well, provides glucose and fructose similar to sport products ([

        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10054587/#:~:text=performance,to%20difficulties%20in%20the%20quantities)) ([
            Carbohydrates and Endurance Exercise: A Narrative Review of a Food First Approach - PMC

Overall, the everyday diet for a marathoner should be **plentiful, balanced, and rich in high-quality carbs**. Foods like pasta, rice, potatoes, whole grains, fruits, and starchy vegetables will form the bulk of meals. Lean proteins (chicken, fish, eggs, legumes, dairy) appear in moderate amounts regularly to hit protein targets. Healthy fats (avocado, nuts, olive oil, fatty fish) round out the diet for satiety and health. This kind of diet not only fuels training but also helps maintain a strong immune system in the face of heavy training stress, by providing ample micronutrients and antioxidants. Consistency is key – marathoners can’t “cram” nutrition at the last minute; they need to fuel their bodies day in and day out.

### Pre-Race Meal (Marathon Day Morning)  
The pre-race meal is the final top-off for energy stores and should be designed to be **rich in carbohydrates, moderate in protein, low in fat and fiber**, and above all, familiar to the runner ([
            International Society of Sports Nutrition Position Stand: nutritional considerations for single-stage ultra-marathon training and racing - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6839090/#:~:text=the%20event%20,gut%20discomfort%20during%20the%20race)). It’s typically eaten about 2–4 hours before the start, depending on individual tolerance and the race start time. Here are some tried-and-true examples of pre-marathon breakfasts:

- **Option 1: Bagel with Peanut Butter and Banana** – A classic among runners. A plain bagel provides ~50 g of easily digestible carbs. Spread a thin layer of peanut butter for a bit of flavor and protein (~8 g protein, 16 g fat if 2 tbsp – but many will go lighter on the PB to keep fat low), and add sliced banana on top for another ~30 g carbs and potassium. This meal sits well for many because bagels are low-fiber (especially if you choose refined grain bagels) and peanut butter, while fatty, is used sparingly just for some taste and to prevent hunger without overloading fat. Total carbs can be ~80 g, protein ~10 g, fat ~10-15 g. It hits that 1–4 g/kg carb recommendation for most athletes (e.g., ~80 g for a 60-70 kg runner is ~1.2 g/kg if 2 hours out – could add sports drink to push it higher if needed) ([
            Nutrition and Supplement Update for the Endurance Athlete: Review and Recommendations - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6628334/#:~:text=gastrointestinal%20,the%20overnight%20fast%20which%20depletes)). The banana’s low-GI carbs and the sodium in the bagel (bagels are fairly high in salt) also help with fluid retention. Many elites go with a similar plan: e.g. a white bagel or toast with a little almond butter and honey plus a banana – this is basically the same nutrient profile.

- **Option 2: Oatmeal with Fruit** – A bowl of oatmeal (made with water or a bit of low-fat milk) topped with say a sliced apple or berries and a spoon of honey. Add a dash of salt and maybe a few nuts if desired. Oats are moderate in fiber, but by using quick oats and not too huge a portion, many find it digestible. For those with sensitive stomachs, using instant oatmeal (more processed) can actually reduce fiber and speed digestion. For example: 1.5 cups cooked oatmeal (~45 g carbs), a tablespoon of honey (~17 g), a diced peach (~15 g) gives ~75 g carbs, minimal fat, ~5-8 g protein. One could also include a hard-boiled egg or a small yogurt on the side if they want ~5–10 g extra protein – but be cautious with too much protein/fat. An elite might have a larger portion or add a sports drink to sip alongside for extra carbs. The fruit provides some fructose which, combined with the maltose from oatmeal, can maximize carbohydrate uptake (multiple transportable carbs). This meal is still mostly low-GI, which is fine because it’s a couple hours out, preventing blood sugar spikes and crashes. According to an ISSN recommendation, a pre-race meal should be **easily digestible and low in fat/fiber** – oatmeal and fruit fits that ([

        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6839090/#:~:text=the%20event%20,gut%20discomfort%20during%20the%20race)), as long as fiber isn’t excessive.

- **Option 3: Pancakes or White Rice with a Bit of Protein** – Some East African elites famously eat plain **white rice** or stiff porridge before races. Rice is very low fiber and gentle; one could have a bowl of white rice with a little soy sauce (for salt) and maybe a boiled egg or small piece of chicken (for those accustomed to a savory breakfast). This might resemble more of a lunch, but it works if that’s the habitual diet. For Western runners, **pancakes** or waffles (made from refined flour) with a little syrup is an appealing carb-rich meal. Two medium pancakes with syrup can easily provide ~70–90 g carbs, and if a bit of egg or egg whites are in the batter, that’s ~8–10 g protein. Just go easy on butter (fat). Some runners like to top pancakes with a smear of jam or honey instead of lots of butter. This is essentially a high-carb, low-fiber meal too. A bit of scrambled egg whites on the side (no cheese, minimal butter in cooking) can add protein without much fat. The key is these foods are bland and low residue. 

- **Option 4: Smoothie (if solid food is hard to stomach)** – For runners too nervous to chew much, a liquid meal might be preferable. A smoothie made with a couple of bananas, a scoop of carbohydrate powder or maltodextrin, a bit of yogurt, and some water can deliver 60–100 g of carbs in a easily sippable form. One could also use liquid meal supplements (like Ensure, Boost, or special sports formulas) that are high in carbs. This approach is often used by elites who have early morning races – they might drink 2 bottles of a carb-rich shake 2 hours out to get ~500 kcal in. This ensures fueling even if appetite is low. The downside is lack of “bulk” might lead to hunger sooner; but one can then sip a sports drink in the final hour to top up.

No matter the menu, a crucial guideline is to **avoid high fat and high fiber content** in this pre-race meal ([
            International Society of Sports Nutrition Position Stand: nutritional considerations for single-stage ultra-marathon training and racing - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6839090/#:~:text=the%20event%20,gut%20discomfort%20during%20the%20race)). That means skip things like greasy bacon, sausage, excessive butter, heavy cheese, and fibrous bran cereals or large salads. Such foods digest slowly and can cause GI distress mid-race. Also avoid very spicy foods. Usually, runners stick to refined grains (white bread, bagels, low-fiber cereal, rice, etc.), some easily digestible protein (small amounts of egg, dairy, or lean meat), and possibly a little fat but not much. If coffee is part of the routine, most will have their normal cup (since caffeine helps, as discussed, and also ensures a bathroom visit pre-run for many). Just don’t experiment with double espresso if you’re not used to it.

**Timing & Quantity:** The target is often given as **1 g of carb per kg, per hour out**. For example, if eating 3 hours before, aim ~3 g/kg carbs ([
            Nutrition and Supplement Update for the Endurance Athlete: Review and Recommendations - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6628334/#:~:text=gastrointestinal%20,the%20overnight%20fast%20which%20depletes)). For a 70 kg runner, that’s ~210 g – which is quite a lot, and not everyone can do that much. Many do half that and then sip a sports drink closer to the start. The meal examples above (~70–100 g carbs) cover a 1.5–2h-out scenario for a ~60–70 kg person. If one has 3–4 hours, they might double those carbs or include an extra snack 1 hour out (like an energy gel or sports drink ~15 min pre-start for an extra 25 g). Elites often wake up 3-4 hours early to eat a big breakfast, then maybe take a gel 15 minutes before the gun. Recreational folks often have 2 hours or less due to logistics, so they might eat a bit less and rely on a gel at the start or sports drink to meet the difference.

**Hydration with the Meal:** It's wise to drink ~500 mL (17 oz) of fluid with the pre-race meal, preferably including electrolytes ([Contemporary Nutrition Strategies to Optimize Performance in Distance Runners and Race Walkers - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30747558/#:~:text=amounts%20sufficient%20for%20event%20fuel,thermal%20challenge%20and%20fluid%20deficit)). For example, having a sports drink or adding a little salt to oatmeal ensures sodium intake which helps the body retain the fluid. Some athletes will drink ~(5–7 ml/kg) of fluid about 2–3 hours pre-race, which for a 70 kg runner is ~350–500 mL, to start well-hydrated ([Contemporary Nutrition Strategies to Optimize Performance in Distance Runners and Race Walkers - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30747558/#:~:text=amounts%20sufficient%20for%20event%20fuel,thermal%20challenge%20and%20fluid%20deficit)). Then they may stop drinking heavily to avoid pit stops, just sipping maybe 100–200 mL in the final hour if needed. Over-hydrating can cause frequent urination and flush electrolytes, so it’s a balance.

In short, an ideal pre-marathon breakfast might be something like: **2 slices of toast with jelly and a small protein (egg or yogurt) + a banana + 1-2 cups of sports drink**, consumed ~2 hours before the race. This is high-carb (~80–100 g), low fiber, low fat, and provides some fluid and sodium – matching sports science recommendations ([
            International Society of Sports Nutrition Position Stand: nutritional considerations for single-stage ultra-marathon training and racing - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6839090/#:~:text=the%20event%20,gut%20discomfort%20during%20the%20race)). It’s also typical of what many marathoners report eating. The most important factor is **familiarity**: the runner should have practiced this meal before long runs to ensure it agrees with them.

### During-Race Fueling  
During the marathon, the focus is on **rapidly digestible carbohydrates and fluids/electrolytes**. Solid foods are generally minimized in a marathon (unlike ultras) because they can be harder to chew and digest at racing intensity. Instead, runners rely on energy gels, chews, sports drinks, and sometimes small easily digestible snacks (like part of a banana). Here are examples of during-race fuel:

- **Energy Gels:** These are concentrated sources of glucose/fructose (~20–30 g carbs per gel pack) with minimal other content (some have a little sodium, some have caffeine). A common strategy is 1 gel every 30–45 minutes, washed down with water. For instance, a runner might take a gel at mile 5, 10, 15, and 20 – totaling ~4 gels (~100+ g carbs) over the race. Gels are essentially the go-to for most marathoners because they are convenient and formulated not to upset the stomach (in most cases). They come in various flavors and with options for added caffeine or electrolytes. **Example:** GU Energy Gel (popular brand) provides ~22 g carbs (mix of maltodextrin and fructose) and ~50–60 mg sodium per packet, and some versions have 20–40 mg caffeine. Taking one at 45-minute intervals yields ~30 g carbs/hour – on the lower end of recommended intake, but many recreational runners do this and supplement with sports drink to reach ~45–60 g/hour total. Elites might take gels more frequently (every 5k which for them is ~15 minutes, but often alternating with drink so effectively every 30 min or so each type). They might even double up late in the race if chasing a record, trying to push towards that 80–90 g/hour intake. 

- **Sports Drinks:** Drinking a carbohydrate-electrolyte solution serves double duty: hydration and fueling. Marathon aid stations typically offer sports drink (e.g. Gatorade Endurance formula, which has ~18 g carbs and ~300 mg sodium per 8 oz cup). A runner could rely on the sports drink for some or all of their carb intake. For example, drinking ~16 oz per hour of Gatorade Endurance would give ~36 g carbs and ~600 mg sodium per hour. If they also take a gel with ~20–25 g, that totals ~55–60 g/hour – a solid fueling rate ([Contemporary Nutrition Strategies to Optimize Performance in Distance Runners and Race Walkers - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30747558/#:~:text=CHO,cooling%20strategies%20may%20provide%20a)). Some athletes prefer liquid nutrition as it may digest even faster; others like a combo to avoid flavor fatigue. **Example Plan:** Drink 1 cup (~4 oz) of sports drink at every aid station (if they are every 2 miles, that’s ~8 oz per ~20–25 min for a 4 hr marathoner, so roughly 20 oz/hour, ~45 g carb/hour). Combined with maybe a gel every 60–75 min, that could reach ~60+ g/hour. The exact plan can vary, but the principle is to **regularly intake carbs from the start, not waiting until feeling tired**. By the time you feel bonk coming, it’s too late; proactive fueling from the first 30 minutes onward is key.

- **Chews or Blocks:** These are basically gummy candies with carbs and sometimes electrolytes/caffeine (e.g. Clif Shot Bloks, Honey Stinger Chews). They often come in 30–60 g packets of multiple chews. A typical chew might have ~4–5 g carbs; a pack of 10 chews ~40–50 g carbs. A runner might nibble on chews continuously – say 2 chews every mile or two. Some prefer these to gels because they can spread the intake gradually (and some find the texture more tolerable than the gel consistency). The caveat is needing to chew can be an issue at high breathing rates, but at recreational paces it’s usually fine. **Example:** A runner carries a pack of chews (about 6 chews = ~24 g carbs per pack). They eat one chew every 10 minutes – that’s ~6 g carbs/10 min, or 36 g/hour. Combined with sports drink sips for another ~20–30 g/hour, that meets ~50–60 g/hour. The combination of glucose and fructose in many chews allows better uptake (e.g. Shot Bloks use brown rice syrup (glucose) and cane sugar (sucrose) mix). Chews also often include electrolytes: e.g. 3 Clif Bloks provide 50 mg sodium, and some versions have 25–50 mg caffeine per serving. 

- **Real Food Options:** Though less common in marathons, some runners do fine with small pieces of real food: e.g., half a banana at an aid station (bananas are often provided in big races), which gives ~15 g carbs and potassium. Orange slices are another race offering – they provide quick fructose and water content, though fiber in the pulp could be an issue for sensitive stomachs. Some might carry a few gummy bears or pretzels for variety; a few gummy candies can mimic chews (they are basically the same minus maybe some electrolytes). Pretzels provide salt and some carbs, but too many can be dry/hard to swallow – usually more used in ultras. Honey packets or maple syrup in a flask is an all-natural alternative to gels (honey is ~17 g carbs per tablespoon, largely sugars that absorb fast; in fact some gels are honey-based). 

If using real foods, the key is they must be **easily digestible and not bulky** ([
            International Society of Sports Nutrition Position Stand: nutritional considerations for single-stage ultra-marathon training and racing - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6839090/#:~:text=the%20event%20,gut%20discomfort%20during%20the%20race)). A marathon is not the time for trail mix or energy bars that are high in fiber/fat/protein – those can cause GI distress. That’s why specialized products dominate; they strip away fiber/fat. However, studies have shown whole-food carbs (like raisins) can perform as well as sports jellybeans for running performance ([
            Carbohydrates and Endurance Exercise: A Narrative Review of a Food First Approach - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10054587/#:~:text=of%20these%20CHO,trial%20CHO%20food%20sources%20before)). Raisins were found to be a cost-effective alternative to sports chews in one study, providing similar run times and being well-tolerated ([
            Carbohydrates and Endurance Exercise: A Narrative Review of a Food First Approach - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10054587/#:~:text=of%20these%20CHO,trial%20CHO%20food%20sources%20before)). Thus, a recreational runner could eat a small box of raisins (~30 g carbs) over an hour instead of a gel if they find it palatable. Still, one must consider hydration; gels typically are taken with water to dilute in stomach. Real foods need to be chased with water too.

- **Electrolyte Supplements During:** As discussed in the supplement section, **salt caps or electrolyte drinks** during the race help maintain sodium. Many gels contain ~50–100 mg sodium per serving, which helps but might not fully cover needs. Sports drinks at the course usually have sodium (e.g. ~200+ mg per cup). Some runners in hot marathons take a salt capsule (about 200–300 mg sodium) at half distance if they feel very sweaty or cramp-prone. Example: a runner might swallow one Endurolyte or SaltStick capsule at mile 13 with water, providing ~250 mg sodium, 15 mg potassium, etc., to reinforce what the sports drink provides. This is more common among recreational runners since elites often rely on their fluids prepared. Cramp-prone runners also use things like HotShot or pickle juice, but those are more “emergency” measures; generally, steady electrolyte intake from drinks/gels prevents reaching that point.

**How to carry/execute:** Elites have bottles on tables; they tape gels to bottles or have them pre-mixed. Recreational runners often wear a running belt that holds 2–4 gels, or pin gels to their shorts. Some marathons hand out gels at certain mile markers (e.g. at 30K). It’s wise not to rely solely on on-course provisions unless you know brand/flavor and have trained with them. Many bring their preferred gels. For hydration, recreational runners mostly use aid stations (taking cups). If one desires a specific drink (like a certain brand or a higher carb mix than provided), they might carry a small flask. 

**Fueling Plan Example (4-hour marathoner):**  
- **0:00 (Start):** Already had breakfast 2 hours prior. 5 minutes before start, take 1 caffeinated gel (25 g carbs, 50 mg caffeine) with a few sips of water – topping off energy and caffeine stores ([
            Nutrition and Supplement Update for the Endurance Athlete: Review and Recommendations - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6628334/#:~:text=,a%20greater%20ergogenic%20effect%20than)).  
- **0:45 (45 min in):** Take 1 gel (~25 g carbs, with some electrolytes) at the aid station, chase with a cup of water.  
- **1:30:** Drink ~8 oz sports drink (~15 g carb) at aid. Eat a few chews (say 2 chews = 8–10 g) as leaving station. (~25 g total this interval).  
- **2:00:** Take another gel (~20–25 g). Also grab half a banana offered at mile 13 (~15 g). This might be ~35–40 g plus fluids. If the banana might be heavy, skip it or only take a few bites. (Could alternatively do chews + sports drink if banana not wanted.) Possibly take a salt capsule if very hot (ensuring also drink water).  
- **2:30:** Drink sports drink (~15 g) and take 1 chew (~4 g) – lighter fueling this half-hour because previous was heavy.  
- **3:00:** Take final gel (~25 g, maybe with caffeine for late boost). Wash with water. Also maybe sip some sports drink (~10 g) if thirsty.  
- **3:30:** If feeling okay, maybe just sports drink (~15 g) at last station. If feeling energy fading, could take an emergency gel or some candy offered by crowd. Many runners can’t tolerate another gel by this point, so even a few sips of cola (if available) or a hard candy can help for mental boost.  
- **Finish (~4:00):** Total consumption: ~4 gels (~100 g), ~2 packs of chews (~20 g), ~various sports drink (~60+ g), banana (~15 g) = roughly 195 g carbs over 4h, which is ~49 g/hour on average. That’s within the recommended 30–60 g/h for recreational. Possibly slightly under target in middle – maybe adding one more chew per hour would bring it to ~55 g/h. Electrolytes: sports drink and gels likely provided ~800–1000 mg sodium in total over 4h, plus any capsule, so that likely kept things balanced.

This plan would vary for an elite (they might do ~60–80 g/hour via more frequent intake, and finish in 2+ hours so total ~150–180 g over race). But the principle stands: start fueling early, regularly intake a combo of drink and gels to hit ~50+ g carbs per hour, include sodium, and use caffeine strategically (most often before or maybe a mid-race low dose).

### Post-Race Recovery Nutrition  
After completing the marathon, the body is in a depleted, fatigued state: glycogen stores are low, muscles have micro-damage, and the runner is likely dehydrated. Proper post-race nutrition aids in **replenishing, repairing, rehydrating, and revitalizing**. It’s often summarized as the Four R’s of recovery: **Rehydrate, Refuel, Repair, and Rest**. Nutrition addresses the first three R’s directly (rest is time/sleep). Key components of recovery nutrition are **carbohydrates** to refuel glycogen, **protein** to repair muscles, and **fluids with electrolytes** to rehydrate ([
            Nutrition and Supplement Update for the Endurance Athlete: Review and Recommendations - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6628334/#:~:text=match%20at%20L726%20commercial%20sports,discussed%20in%20Recovery%20Nutrition%20section)) ([
            Carbohydrates and Endurance Exercise: A Narrative Review of a Food First Approach - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10054587/#:~:text=exercise%20event%20to%20ensure%20that,of%20the%20previous%20exercise%20bout)).

**Immediately (0–30 minutes post-finish):** The runner may not feel like eating solid food right away – intense exercise can suppress appetite transiently – but this window is great for recovery nutrition. **Liquids or light snacks** are often most palatable right after finishing. Examples: 

- **Chocolate Milk:** Touted as an ideal recovery drink, chocolate milk naturally has ~3:1 to 4:1 ratio of carbs:protein (about 30 g carbs, 8 g protein per 8 oz) and contains fluids and electrolytes like calcium and sodium. Research has shown chocolate milk is as effective as commercial recovery beverages for promoting glycogen resynthesis and muscle repair ([From BS&W: Nutrition - Fuel for your Training | The Cowtown Marathon](https://www.cowtownmarathon.org/post/nutrition-fuel-for-your-training#:~:text=From%20BS%26W%3A%20Nutrition%20,is%20low%20in%20fat)). Many marathon finish lines now offer chocolate milk. An elite might chug 16 oz (getting ~60 g carb, 16 g protein) which begins recovery quickly. Recreational runners also find it convenient and palatable. Lactose-intolerant athletes might use a lactose-free version or a plant-based milk with similar nutrient profile (some soy or pea protein drinks are formulated as “vegan recovery shakes” with added cocoa for flavor).

- **Recovery Shake or Sports Drink + Protein:** Some prefer a specialized recovery shake powder mixed with water (often containing ~20 g whey protein plus ~40–80 g carbs from maltodextrin or sugars). For instance, a runner could have a bottle of Gatorade (which provides ~34 g carb in 20 oz) and eat a protein bar (with ~20 g protein, 25 g carbs) in the finish area. Together that gives ~60 g carbs, 20 g protein. Or they might mix a packet of recovery drink (like Endurox R4 or Skratch Labs Recovery) in water – these products typically hit the 4:1 carb:protein ratio (e.g. 50 g carb, 12 g protein). The exact brand is less important than getting those macros in. **Key target:** about **1.0–1.2 g/kg of carbs and ~0.25–0.4 g/kg of protein within the first hour** ([
            Carbohydrates and Endurance Exercise: A Narrative Review of a Food First Approach - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10054587/#:~:text=exercise%20event%20to%20ensure%20that,of%20the%20previous%20exercise%20bout)) (for a 70 kg runner, ~70-85 g carbs, ~18-28 g protein). This immediate feeding helps maximize glycogen restoration and initiates muscle protein synthesis while the muscles are highly receptive (the so-called anabolic window). 

- **Banana + Whey Protein:** If no fancy products are around, simple choices work. A banana provides ~30 g fast-acting carbs and some potassium; a scoop of whey protein in water gives ~20-25 g protein and some BCAAs for muscle repair. This combo is easy to carry and consume. Add a pinch of salt or some pretzels for sodium if needed. Some runners pack a recovery kit with these items in their checked bag.

- **Electrolyte Drink:** Rehydrating is crucial. Ideally, weigh yourself before and after the race if possible to know how much fluid was lost. If down 2 kg, aim to drink ~3 L over the next hours along with food to fully rehydrate. Often runners crave something not too sweet after all the gels – so an electrolyte beverage like Pedialyte, Nuun in water, or even a light beer (beer has carbs and fluid, though alcohol can impede rehydration slightly, so non-alcoholic beer is actually a trendy recovery drink in some places) can quench thirst and provide sodium. Water alone is okay, but adding electrolyte accelerates recovery by retaining water better ([
            Nutrition and Supplement Update for the Endurance Athlete: Review and Recommendations - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6628334/#:~:text=match%20at%20L726%20commercial%20sports,discussed%20in%20Recovery%20Nutrition%20section)). 

**Within 2 Hours Post-Race:** Once the runner’s stomach settles and appetite returns (usually within an hour or two), a more substantial **meal** should be consumed. This meal should be high in carbs, contain a good amount of protein, and some healthy fats and micronutrients to aid overall recovery and immune function. Some examples:

- **Burrito or Wrap:** A whole-grain tortilla wrap with grilled chicken (or beans), rice, black beans, cheese, lettuce, salsa, and guacamole. This provides a mix of carbs from the tortilla and rice (e.g. ~80–100 g carbs if a large burrito with rice and beans), protein from chicken/beans/cheese (~30 g+), and sodium from the salsa/seasoning (which helps replace salt lost) ([
            Nutrition and Supplement Update for the Endurance Athlete: Review and Recommendations - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6628334/#:~:text=environmental%20conditions,and%20the%20average%20sodium)). The avocado gives healthy fat and magnesium. It’s a hearty meal that will replenish glycogen and provide amino acids for muscle repair. Many runners find they get ravenous a couple hours post-finish, so something like a burrito is very satisfying. (One caution: if your stomach is still sensitive, keep things like hot salsa or super spicy foods moderate initially).

- **Pizza with Lean Protein:** Pizza offers lots of carbs in the crust and is usually high in salt, which can actually be beneficial post-marathon to help restore electrolyte balance. Adding a lean protein topping like chicken or having a side of cottage cheese can bump the protein. Example: 3 slices of veggie and chicken pizza might give ~90 g carbs, ~30 g protein, and lots of sodium. Pizza also has fat, which is fine in recovery (no need to avoid fat after exercise, since immediate digestion speed is less critical than during exercise). Plus, if that’s what the runner craves, it’s better to eat something palatable than force something “perfect.” Many recreational runners celebrate with pizza and beer – not the textbook ideal, but the pizza actually hits many recovery needs (carbs, protein, salt). The beer (alcohol) in moderation (1 beer) probably won’t derail recovery and provides some carbs and fluid; but more alcohol could impede muscle recovery and rehydration, so moderation is key. A non-alcoholic beer is a fine alternative which provides maltose (carbs) and polyphenols without the ethanol.

- **Protein-Rich Grain Bowl:** A bowl with quinoa or rice, roasted vegetables, a protein like salmon or tofu, and perhaps a yogurt-based sauce. For example, a bowl containing 1 cup quinoa (~40 g carbs), a piece of salmon (~25 g protein, plus omega-3 fats which may help reduce inflammation), roasted sweet potatoes and broccoli (~20 g carbs, lots of vitamin A/C), and a dollop of Greek yogurt or tahini sauce. This is a nutrient-dense recovery meal supplying quality protein, high GI and low GI carbs, and antioxidants from veggies to aid muscle recovery. It aligns with recommendations to include protein with carbs to stimulate muscle protein synthesis and glycogen refilling ([
            Carbohydrates and Endurance Exercise: A Narrative Review of a Food First Approach - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10054587/#:~:text=exercise%20event%20to%20ensure%20that,of%20the%20previous%20exercise%20bout)).

- **Pasta with Meat and Veggies:** Another classic – perhaps penne pasta with a tomato-meat sauce and a side of spinach salad. Pasta will reload glycogen (add breadsticks if more carbs needed), the meat or plant protein in sauce provides protein and iron/zinc, tomato sauce offers potassium and antioxidants, and a salad with mixed greens, tomatoes, and bell peppers gives vitamin C and other micronutrients. A bit of olive oil on the salad adds healthy fat. This type of meal ensures the runner’s energy stores are being refilled and tissue repair is supported. It’s no coincidence that many post-race parties serve things like pasta or chili – they are effective recovery foods.

**Micronutrients in Recovery:** It’s beneficial to include fruits and/or vegetables in the post-race period to supply vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants that can help combat oxidative stress from the marathon. For instance, berries or tart cherry juice can help reduce inflammation and muscle soreness (tart cherry juice is actually studied for reducing post-marathon inflammation and perceived muscle pain due to its anthocyanin content). Some runners do a regimen of tart cherry juice (8–12 oz daily) for a few days around the race to aid recovery. Similarly, pineapple or papaya are thought to help due to bromelain and vitamin C. While not magic, including a fruit smoothie or veggie soup in the recovery phase certainly won’t hurt and likely helps overall recovery and immune support.

**Rehydration specifics:** A simple guideline is to **replace 150% of the weight lost as fluid** over the next 4–6 hours ([
            Nutrition and Supplement Update for the Endurance Athlete: Review and Recommendations - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6628334/#:~:text=match%20at%20L726%20commercial%20sports,discussed%20in%20Recovery%20Nutrition%20section)). So if down 2 kg (~2 L water), drink about 3 L. Including sodium at ~~1 g per liter helps the body retain this fluid ([
            Nutrition and Supplement Update for the Endurance Athlete: Review and Recommendations - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6628334/#:~:text=environmental%20conditions,and%20the%20average%20sodium)). This could be through an electrolyte solution, brothy soup, salted foods, etc. Listen to thirst as well – the body will often crave salt and fluids. Avoid excessive alcohol initially as it can promote diuresis; one celebratory drink is fine but then focus on water/electrolytes. 

**Rest of Day:** Keep snacking every 2 hours on carb-protein foods if possible. For example, trail mix or a peanut butter sandwich later, maybe another meal if hungry. The day of the marathon, the runner’s metabolism is high and muscles are hungry to store fuel. It’s common to be very hungry by evening (if the race was morning) – it’s okay to indulge somewhat, just also ensure some quality nutrients are included. 

**Next Days:** For 24-48 hours after, maintain a high protein intake (~1.5–2.0 g/kg if possible) and plenty of carbs to fully restore muscle glycogen (especially if planning to return to training soon). Also, **omega-3 fatty acids** (fish, walnuts, flax) and spices like turmeric or ginger can help manage inflammation. Adequate sleep and perhaps compression and stretching complement the nutritional recovery.

In summary, an ideal recovery regimen for a marathoner could be: **Finish line:** drink a bottle of sports drink and eat a banana (or chocolate milk); **Within 30 min:** have a recovery shake or some quick snack with carbs+protein ([

By following this, both elite and recreational runners can significantly speed up their recovery, reduce muscle soreness, and restore energy. It sets the stage for rebuilding stronger. 

**Practical note:** After a marathon, sometimes the GI system is a bit off (some runners experience nausea or cannot handle big meals immediately). In such cases, focus on fluids and light, easily digestible foods first (e.g. broth, crackers, yogurt), then progress to heartier fare as able. The body’s signals should be heeded; often, light carbs first, then protein as appetite returns.

---

These examples illustrate how theoretical nutrition guidelines translate to real foods. They emphasize that **common, accessible foods** can meet the needs: e.g. oatmeal, bananas, sandwiches, pasta, chocolate milk – these are not exotic superfoods, but they are super *effective*. That aligns with a “food first” approach recommended by sports dietitians ([
            Carbohydrates and Endurance Exercise: A Narrative Review of a Food First Approach - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10054587/#:~:text=Carbohydrate%20,to%20the%20ingestion%20of%20some)). However, specialized sports products (gels, sports drinks, recovery powders) are used at specific times (during and immediately after exercise) for convenience and efficiency. Both elites and recreational runners can use a combination of everyday foods and sports products to implement an optimal nutrition plan. Ultimately, the best choices are those that **the runner can consistently consume and tolerate**, while meeting the macro and micronutrient targets for training and racing. Adjustments are made based on individual preferences (e.g. lactose-free if needed, vegetarian alternatives, flavor choices for drinks/gels, etc.), but the underlying strategy remains: high carbs around workouts and race, sufficient protein throughout the day, moderate fat, and plenty of fluids/electrolytes and micronutrient-rich foods for overall health and recovery.

## Summary and Practical Recommendations  

**Marathon nutrition** is both an art and a science – it requires applying evidence-based principles to one’s individual needs and tolerances. The scientific consensus for optimal marathon performance is that a **high-carbohydrate diet** is paramount to fuel the prolonged running effort, supplemented by adequate protein for recovery and moderate fat for overall health. Proper micronutrient intake (especially iron, magnesium, and sodium) underpins endurance capacity and should not be overlooked. Additionally, targeted use of proven ergogenic supplements like caffeine and nitrates can provide a performance edge. Below is a summary of key findings and practical tips, applicable to both elite and recreational runners (with notes on differences where relevant):

- **Carbohydrate is King:** Carbs are the primary fuel for marathon running. Marathoners should consume **6–10+ g/kg of carbohydrates per day** during heavy training ([
            Nutrition and Supplement Update for the Endurance Athlete: Review and Recommendations - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6628334/#:~:text=Academy%20of%20Nutrition%20and%20Dietetics,29)) to maintain glycogen stores – that means making carbs the centerpiece of most meals (e.g. grains, potatoes, fruits). In the 1–3 days before the race, **carbo-load** by upping intake to ~8–12 g/kg/day while tapering training, which can improve performance by allowing you to run longer at target pace before “hitting the wall” ([
            Nutrition and Supplement Update for the Endurance Athlete: Review and Recommendations - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6628334/#:~:text=Prior%20to%20the%20race%20,or%20even%20complete%20physical)) ([
            Nutrition and Supplement Update for the Endurance Athlete: Review and Recommendations - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6628334/#:~:text=Traditionally%20it%20had%20been%20recommended,In%20the)). This might involve extra pasta, rice, bread, and sports drinks – plan high-carb, low-fiber meals during this period. On race morning, eat a **familiar high-CHO breakfast** (such as 1–4 g/kg carbs, 2–3 hours pre-start) to top off energy ([
            Nutrition and Supplement Update for the Endurance Athlete: Review and Recommendations - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6628334/#:~:text=gastrointestinal%20,the%20overnight%20fast%20which%20depletes)). During the marathon, **consume 30–60 g of carbs per hour (up to ~90 g/h if tolerated)** via gels, chews, and sports drinks ([Contemporary Nutrition Strategies to Optimize Performance in Distance Runners and Race Walkers - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30747558/#:~:text=CHO,cooling%20strategies%20may%20provide%20a)). Start fueling early in the race (around 30 min in) rather than waiting for fatigue. Consistent intake of carbs and some fluid will help stave off the dreaded bonk. *Elites* typically achieve the higher end of intake (60–90 g/h using customized drinks/gels), while *recreational* runners should aim for at least ~30 g/h and work upwards with training practice – even a modest intake gives a clear benefit over water alone ([Contemporary Nutrition Strategies to Optimize Performance in Distance Runners and Race Walkers - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30747558/#:~:text=CHO,cooling%20strategies%20may%20provide%20a)). Train the gut by using your planned fuels on long runs. Remember: **carbs drive performance** – marathoners should never attempt a low-carb approach on race day, as it severely compromises speed and endurance ([Nutrition strategies for the marathon : fuel for training and racing - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17465604/#:~:text=restoration%20of%20muscle%20glycogen%20between,likely%20to%20happen%20as%20the)).

- **Protein for Recovery and Retention:** Endurance running still breaks down muscle fibers; protein is needed to repair them and build enzymes, as well as to support immune function. Aim for **1.2–1.6 g/kg of protein daily** (up to ~2.0 g/kg in heavy training or if aiming for lean muscle mass) ([
            Nutrition and Supplement Update for the Endurance Athlete: Review and Recommendations - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6628334/#:~:text=The%20AND%2C%20DC%2C%20and%20ACSM,lower%20range%2C%20based%20on%20individual)). Spread protein across meals, ~20–25 g (0.3 g/kg) per meal or snack, to maximize absorption and muscle protein synthesis ([
            Nutrition and Supplement Update for the Endurance Athlete: Review and Recommendations - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6628334/#:~:text=match%20at%20L504%20performance%20,8)). Good sources include lean meat, poultry, fish, eggs, dairy, soy, legumes, and nuts. For example, incorporate yogurt or eggs at breakfast, lean protein at lunch and dinner, and recovery shakes or bars after workouts. In the **post-exercise window**, take ~20–30 g protein along with carbs to kick-start muscle repair ([
            Nutrition and Supplement Update for the Endurance Athlete: Review and Recommendations - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6628334/#:~:text=match%20at%20L504%20performance%20,8)). A practical tip is to consume a protein-rich snack or shake within an hour after long runs or intense sessions (chocolate milk, whey protein with fruit, etc.). *Elites* often nail their protein intake with scheduled recovery meals and may lean towards the higher end (1.5–2 g/kg) especially if training at high altitude or with strength training sessions; *recreational* runners should ensure at least the lower end (~1.2–1.4 g/kg) as a minimum, as many recreational athletes under-eat protein. Meeting protein needs will help reduce muscle soreness and preserve lean body mass over months of training.

- **Don’t Fear Fats (But Time Them Wisely):** Healthy fats are needed for hormone production, vitamin absorption, and as an auxiliary fuel for low-intensity training. **20–35% of total calories from fat** is a good range for athletes ([
            Nutrition and Supplement Update for the Endurance Athlete: Review and Recommendations - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6628334/#:~:text=match%20at%20L426%20Fat%20Do,race%20if%20GI%20comfort%20concerns)). Focus on unsaturated fats: olive oil, avocado, nuts, seeds, peanut butter, and oily fish (for omega-3s). For example, include a handful of nuts or a bit of nut butter daily, use olive oil on salads, and eat fatty fish 1–2x/week. However, avoid very high-fat meals right before running or during key carb-loading times ([
            Nutrition and Supplement Update for the Endurance Athlete: Review and Recommendations - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6628334/#:~:text=Fat%20Do%20not%20restrict%20to,race%20if%20GI%20comfort%20concerns)). Fatty foods can slow digestion; thus, for pre-race and pre-long run meals, keep fat content low to prevent GI upset ([
            International Society of Sports Nutrition Position Stand: nutritional considerations for single-stage ultra-marathon training and racing - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6839090/#:~:text=the%20event%20,gut%20discomfort%20during%20the%20race)). *Elites* usually eat moderate fat diets (~25% of kcal) and often naturally periodize fat intake (lower on heavy carb days, slightly higher on easy days for satiety). *Recreational* runners should similarly include some fat each day for health, but remember that excess fatty or fried foods at the wrong times can interfere with fueling (e.g., a greasy burger the night before a race could cause issues). The bottom line: include fats for health and flavor, but **prioritize carbs around training** and keep pre-race meals low in fat.

- **Micronutrient Must-Haves:** Pay special attention to certain vitamins and minerals:
  - **Iron:** Iron is critical for oxygen transport. Iron deficiency will noticeably hurt endurance (causing fatigue, heavy legs) ([
            Exploring the Relationship between Micronutrients and Athletic Performance: A Comprehensive Scientific Systematic Review of the Literature in Sports Medicine - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10302780/#:~:text=Iron%20deficiency%2C%20whether%20combined%20with,61)). Runners – especially women – should get iron-rich foods (red meat, poultry, fish, leafy greens, legumes, fortified cereals) regularly. Combine plant sources with vitamin C (e.g. oatmeal with strawberries, spinach salad with orange slices) to boost absorption. It’s wise to have iron status (ferritin levels) checked periodically. If ferritin is low, work with a doctor on supplementation. *Elite runners* often monitor iron closely and may supplement to keep ferritin in an optimal range (not just low-normal). *Recreational runners* should ensure they aren’t unknowingly anemic – persistent fatigue might warrant a blood test. Aim to meet the RDA (18 mg/day for women, 8 mg for men, possibly more when training hard). **Do not supplement iron without confirming deficiency**, as excess iron can be harmful ([
            Exploring the Relationship between Micronutrients and Athletic Performance: A Comprehensive Scientific Systematic Review of the Literature in Sports Medicine - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10302780/#:~:text=,149)).
  - **Magnesium:** Important for energy metabolism, muscle contraction, and preventing cramps. Found in nuts, seeds, whole grains, beans, leafy greens. Marathon training can increase magnesium needs, and marginal deficiency can impair performance ([
            Exploring the Relationship between Micronutrients and Athletic Performance: A Comprehensive Scientific Systematic Review of the Literature in Sports Medicine - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10302780/#:~:text=,and%20found%20a%20direct%20correlation)). Include magnesium-rich foods daily – e.g. a handful of almonds (1 oz has ~75 mg Mg) or a cup of spinach (~150 mg). The RDA (310–400 mg) is a good target ([
            Exploring the Relationship between Micronutrients and Athletic Performance: A Comprehensive Scientific Systematic Review of the Literature in Sports Medicine - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10302780/#:~:text=Magnesium%20,66)). If you experience muscle cramps or poor recovery and suspect low magnesium, consider a supplement (like magnesium glycinate ~200-300 mg) after consulting a professional. *Elites* with very high sweat rates or those restricting calories might supplement magnesium to ensure optimal levels. *Recreational* runners typically can meet needs with a balanced diet, but many general diets fall short, so attention to Mg foods or a multivitamin with Mg can help. Adequate magnesium will aid recovery and may reduce risk of cramps or elevated blood pressure from training ([
            Exploring the Relationship between Micronutrients and Athletic Performance: A Comprehensive Scientific Systematic Review of the Literature in Sports Medicine - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10302780/#:~:text=Athletes%20who%20are%20insufficient%20in,increase%20the%20risk%20of%20hypertension)).
  - **Sodium & Electrolytes:** Long runs and races can deplete sodium, leading to dehydration or hyponatremia. **Include sodium in your hydration plan**. During runs >2 hours, consume sports drinks or electrolyte capsules to intake ~300–600 mg sodium per hour ([
            Nutrition and Supplement Update for the Endurance Athlete: Review and Recommendations - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6628334/#:~:text=match%20at%20L726%20commercial%20sports,discussed%20in%20Recovery%20Nutrition%20section)). This helps maintain fluid balance and muscle function. After runs, replace salt losses by eating some salty foods (pretzels, soup, salted peanut butter) or electrolyte beverages. Listen to your body – craving something salty is a sign. *Slower recreational runners* should be especially cautious about drinking only water in a marathon; always alternate with sports drink or take salt, as they are at higher risk of dilutional hyponatremia ([
            Nutrition and Supplement Update for the Endurance Athlete: Review and Recommendations - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6628334/#:~:text=illustrated%20in%20the%202007%20ACSM,40)). *Elites* sweat a lot too but their shorter finish times reduce total exposure; nonetheless, they often add extra sodium to their drinks in hot races. A simple rule: ensure your daily diet isn’t “ultra-low sodium” – athletes actually need moderate salt. Consuming around 3-5 g of sodium per day (which is more than the general population needs) is common for marathoners, especially in hot climates ([
            Nutrition and Supplement Update for the Endurance Athlete: Review and Recommendations - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6628334/#:~:text=environmental%20conditions,and%20the%20average%20sodium)). Don’t restrict salt if you’re training hard, unless medically advised. However, also don’t overdrink plain water; balance fluid and electrolytes.

  - **Other micros:** Calcium and Vitamin D for bones (get 1000+ mg calcium via dairy or fortified alternatives, and maintain vitamin D through sunlight or supplements especially if deficient – key for stress fracture prevention) ([
            Exploring the Relationship between Micronutrients and Athletic Performance: A Comprehensive Scientific Systematic Review of the Literature in Sports Medicine - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10302780/#:~:text=Calcium%20plays%20a%20crucial%20role,63)). B-vitamins (thiamin, riboflavin, B6, B12, folate) are needed for energy metabolism and red blood cell production; a varied diet with whole grains, veggies, and lean meats/eggs covers these, but vegetarians need a B12 source. Vitamin C and antioxidants from fruits/veggies support the immune system and connective tissue – aim for at least 5 servings of fruits & vegetables daily. *Elites* often have personalized micronutrient regimens (like high-dose vitamin D if levels are low, or iron, etc.), whereas *recreational* runners can usually cover bases with a balanced diet or a basic multivitamin if diet is suboptimal. In general, focus on a **colorful, whole-food diet**: it naturally supplies these micronutrients that keep you healthy and training consistently.

- **Ergogenic Supplements (Use What Works, Ditch the Hype):** Only a few supplements have strong evidence for improving endurance performance:
  - **Caffeine:** Perhaps the most reliable performance booster. A moderate dose (≈3–6# Optimal Nutrition Strategies for Marathon Running

## Introduction  
Marathon running places extreme demands on the body’s energy systems and recovery processes. Optimal nutrition is crucial to fuel training, enhance performance on race day, and aid recovery. Both elite and recreational marathoners benefit from evidence-based dietary strategies, though elites often fine-tune these to a greater degree (e.g. higher absolute intakes and personalized plans) while recreational runners may need to adapt guidelines to their tolerance and lifestyle. In general, **carbohydrates** are the primary fuel for endurance running, **protein** supports muscle recovery, and **fat** provides essential nutrients and a secondary energy source. Adequate **micronutrients** (vitamins and minerals) are needed to sustain performance and health, and certain **supplements** have proven ergogenic benefits for endurance. Below, we break down optimal marathon nutrition by macronutrients, micronutrients, and evidence-backed supplements, and provide practical food examples for both training and race day. Differences between elites and recreational runners are noted where relevant (e.g. elites may sustain higher carb intake during races, whereas recreational runners must be cautious with gastrointestinal comfort and hydration). A summary of key recommendations is provided at the end.

## Macronutrients in Marathon Training and Racing  

Marathoners must balance carbohydrates, proteins, and fats to meet the high energy expenditure of training and racing. The **ratios** often shift during training versus race prep, but all three macros remain important. Timing and quantity of intake are critical – for example, when to carbo-load, how to space protein intake, and minimizing fat around key workouts or race day. Below we discuss each macronutrient:

### Carbohydrates  
**Role & Daily Needs:** Carbohydrates (CHO) are the dominant fuel for marathon running, supplying glucose for muscle glycogen. High daily carb intake is needed to support the heavy training load and to refill glycogen stores between sessions ([
            Nutrition and Supplement Update for the Endurance Athlete: Review and Recommendations - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6628334/#:~:text=Carbohydrate%20,run%20at%2016%20km%2Fh%20for)) ([
            Nutrition and Supplement Update for the Endurance Athlete: Review and Recommendations - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6628334/#:~:text=Academy%20of%20Nutrition%20and%20Dietetics,29)). Sports nutrition guidelines suggest endurance athletes doing moderate training (~1 hour/day) consume about **5–7 g of carbohydrate per kg body weight per day** (g/kg/day), increasing to **6–10 g/kg/day** for 1–3 hours of training, and up to **8–12 g/kg/day** for extreme high-volume training ([
            Nutrition and Supplement Update for the Endurance Athlete: Review and Recommendations - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6628334/#:~:text=Academy%20of%20Nutrition%20and%20Dietetics,29)). Elite marathoners typically fall on the higher end due to their intense, high-mileage regimens, whereas recreational runners with lower training volume may aim for the middle of these ranges. However, even recreational runners should target the upper ranges on heavy training days to ensure optimal recovery and performance. Carbs are a more oxygen-efficient fuel than fat, yielding more energy (ATP) per liter of O₂; when muscle and liver glycogen run low, fatigue (“hitting the wall”) ensues ([
            Nutrition and Supplement Update for the Endurance Athlete: Review and Recommendations - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6628334/#:~:text=Carbohydrate%20,run%20at%2016%20km%2Fh%20for)). Thus, ample carbohydrate is the foundation of a marathoner’s diet to delay fatigue. 

**Training Considerations:** To **recover optimally** and “train hard” day to day, marathoners should consume enough carbs to fully replenish glycogen after key workouts ([Nutrition strategies for the marathon : fuel for training and racing - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17465604/#:~:text=final%20days%20before%20the%20marathon,benefits%20as%20a%20depletion%20phase)). This generally means prioritizing carbohydrate in each meal and snack around training. Many elites distribute carbs strategically (periodization), sometimes training on slightly lower glycogen to stimulate adaptation, but there is **no strong evidence** that chronic low-carb diets improve endurance training outcomes ([Nutrition strategies for the marathon : fuel for training and racing - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17465604/#:~:text=restoration%20of%20muscle%20glycogen%20between,likely%20to%20happen%20as%20the)). In fact, prolonged low-CHO availability can impair training intensity and performance ([Nutrition strategies for the marathon : fuel for training and racing - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17465604/#:~:text=restoration%20of%20muscle%20glycogen%20between,likely%20to%20happen%20as%20the)). Most research supports a high-carb diet for maximizing training quality. That said, some athletes practice “train low, race high” – occasionally doing base runs with low glycogen (to boost fat oxidation) but always restoring carbs for hard sessions and races ([
            Nutrition and Supplement Update for the Endurance Athlete: Review and Recommendations - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6628334/#:~:text=a%20%E2%80%9Ctrain%20low%E2%80%9D%20strategy%20involving,This%20low%20glucose%20state)) ([
            Nutrition and Supplement Update for the Endurance Athlete: Review and Recommendations - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6628334/#:~:text=70,70)). This approach remains experimental; the consensus is that a balanced high-CHO diet is optimal for marathon training for both recreational and elite runners.

**Race Week & Carb-Loading:** In the final days before a marathon, athletes often **carbohydrate-load** to maximize glycogen stores. For races longer than ~90 minutes (which includes the marathon), a classic *glycogen supercompensation* protocol can improve performance by ~2–3% ([
            Nutrition and Supplement Update for the Endurance Athlete: Review and Recommendations - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6628334/#:~:text=Prior%20to%20the%20race%20,However%20recent)). Modern protocols are more convenient than older methods: simply tapering exercise and consuming ~**10–12 g/kg/day of carbs for 1–2 days** prior to the race is usually sufficient to fully top up muscle glycogen ([
            Nutrition and Supplement Update for the Endurance Athlete: Review and Recommendations - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6628334/#:~:text=Traditionally%20it%20had%20been%20recommended,In%20the)). Research shows you **do not** need a depletion phase of exhaustive exercise followed by a week of high carbs – even a short bout of high-intensity exercise or complete rest, followed by one day of very high carb intake (~10–12 g/kg), can achieve near-maximal glycogen stores ([
            Nutrition and Supplement Update for the Endurance Athlete: Review and Recommendations - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6628334/#:~:text=Traditionally%20it%20had%20been%20recommended,1%E2%80%934%20g%2Fkg%20CHO%20is%20recommended)). During these carb-loading days, runners often reduce fiber and limit very fatty foods to avoid gastrointestinal (GI) bulk; the emphasis is on easily digestible starches and sugars. For example, an elite 70 kg runner might eat on the order of 700 g of carbs per day during carb-loading (e.g. pasta, rice, bread, sports drinks, fruit, low-fiber cereals). A recreational runner will scale this to their body weight – e.g. a 60 kg runner targeting ~600 g carbs in carb-load – which still requires consciously high carb portions. Notably, elite runners have higher absolute intakes and may tolerate ~12 g/kg, whereas recreational runners should aim for at least ~8–10 g/kg if possible ([
            Nutrition and Supplement Update for the Endurance Athlete: Review and Recommendations - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6628334/#:~:text=Academy%20of%20Nutrition%20and%20Dietetics,29)). In both cases, the goal is the same: start the marathon with maximized glycogen stores.

**Pre-Race Meal (Race Morning):** On race day, a final pre-race meal helps top off liver glycogen (which can deplete overnight) and maintain blood sugar. The general guideline is **1–4 g/kg of carbohydrates about 1–4 hours before** the start ([
            Nutrition and Supplement Update for the Endurance Athlete: Review and Recommendations - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6628334/#:~:text=gastrointestinal%20,the%20overnight%20fast%20which%20depletes)). Runners should choose a familiar, easily digestible meal that is high in carbs, moderate in protein, and low in fat and fiber to minimize GI distress ([
            International Society of Sports Nutrition Position Stand: nutritional considerations for single-stage ultra-marathon training and racing - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6839090/#:~:text=the%20event%20,gut%20discomfort%20during%20the%20race)). For example, 2–3 hours before the race an athlete might have oatmeal with a banana and honey, or white toast with peanut butter and a sports drink – providing ~100+ grams of low-GI carbs. Elite runners often eat closer to 3–4 hours prior due to early race start times, while recreational runners might have a lighter breakfast if nerves are high, but **should still aim for ~1–2 g/kg** even in a shorter window (e.g. ~70–140 g for a 70 kg runner a couple hours out). Critical is that the foods are *tried in training* – “nothing new on race day.” As an ISSN position stand emphasizes, the pre-race meal should be **familiar, easily-digestible, rich in low-glycemic carbs, and low in fat/fiber** to avoid gut discomfort ([
            International Society of Sports Nutrition Position Stand: nutritional considerations for single-stage ultra-marathon training and racing - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6839090/#:~:text=the%20event%20,gut%20discomfort%20during%20the%20race)).

**During the Marathon (Carbohydrate Fueling):** Consuming carbohydrates during the race is a proven strategy to maintain blood glucose, delay glycogen depletion, and improve performance. The capacity to absorb and use carbs during exercise is limited, so the recommended intake depends on race duration and individual tolerance. For events like the marathon (~2–5 hours), sports nutrition research suggests targeting **~30–60 grams of carbohydrate per hour**, and well-trained athletes may benefit from up to ~90 g/h in longer races if they have trained their gut to handle it ([Contemporary Nutrition Strategies to Optimize Performance in Distance Runners and Race Walkers - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30747558/#:~:text=CHO,cooling%20strategies%20may%20provide%20a)). Elite marathoners, who complete the race in ~2–2.5 hours, often ingest ~60–80+ g/h (typically via sports drinks and gels) to sustain their high running intensity ([Contemporary Nutrition Strategies to Optimize Performance in Distance Runners and Race Walkers - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30747558/#:~:text=CHO,cooling%20strategies%20may%20provide%20a)). For example, many elites plan ~4–6 energy gels (20–25 g each) over a marathon and supplement with carb-rich drinks to approach the upper intake range. Recreational runners going 4+ hours can also benefit from high carb intake, but they may opt for the lower end (~30–50 g/h) if that is all they can tolerate, since GI issues become more likely at higher intake without acclimatization. Even **small amounts** of carbohydrate can help – for instance, rinsing the mouth with a carbohydrate solution has been shown to improve performance in shorter endurance events, leveraging central nervous system effects ([Contemporary Nutrition Strategies to Optimize Performance in Distance Runners and Race Walkers - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30747558/#:~:text=CHO,cooling%20strategies%20may%20provide%20a)). For the marathon, however, a steady intake is preferred. Practically, runners can consume a gel (≈20–30 g) every 30–45 minutes with water, or sip a sports drink providing ~30–60 g per hour. Products combining multiple carb sources (e.g. glucose + fructose) enable higher absorption rates (~90 g/h) and are used by many elites ([Contemporary Nutrition Strategies to Optimize Performance in Distance Runners and Race Walkers - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30747558/#:~:text=CHO,cooling%20strategies%20may%20provide%20a)). The key is to **practice** fueling during long training runs to train the digestive system. Well-conditioned elite runners often tolerate aggressive carb feeding with minimal issues, whereas recreational runners should build up intake gradually to avoid stomach upset. Nonetheless, the performance benefit of carb fueling during the marathon is substantial for both groups – it spares muscle glycogen and prevents the precipitous drop in blood sugar that causes the infamous “bonk” ([
            Nutrition and Supplement Update for the Endurance Athlete: Review and Recommendations - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6628334/#:~:text=Carbohydrate%20,run%20at%2016%20km%2Fh%20for)).

**Post-Run Recovery (Carbs):** After long training runs and the marathon itself, high-carb foods aid rapid glycogen replenishment. This is most crucial when recovery time is short (e.g. training again the next day). A general recommendation is to ingest **~1.0–1.2 g/kg of carbohydrate in the first hour or two after** intense or long exercise, and continue regular carbohydrate intake in subsequent hours ([
            Carbohydrates and Endurance Exercise: A Narrative Review of a Food First Approach - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10054587/#:~:text=exercise%20event%20to%20ensure%20that,of%20the%20previous%20exercise%20bout)). In practice, combining carbs with some protein immediately post-exercise can enhance glycogen re-synthesis and kick-start muscle repair. For example, a recovery drink of 60–80 g glucose with 15–20 g protein (approximately a 3:1 or 4:1 carb:protein ratio) within 30 minutes post-run is a common strategy. High glycemic index carbs (such as white bread, rice, potatoes, or a sports drink) are effective in this window ([How much carb do you need to optimise recovery after exercise?](https://www.precisionhydration.com/performance-advice/nutrition/post-exercise-carbohydrate-recommendations/#:~:text=How%20much%20carb%20do%20you,Then%2C%20you%20can)) ([
            Carbohydrates and Endurance Exercise: A Narrative Review of a Food First Approach - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10054587/#:~:text=exercise%20event%20to%20ensure%20that,of%20the%20previous%20exercise%20bout)). While immediate refueling is less urgent for recreational runners who may have days to recover, it is still beneficial for reducing fatigue and muscle soreness. Both elite and recreational runners should follow a long run or race with a substantial meal rich in carbs to fully restore glycogen over the next 24 hours. As one review notes, the **speed of recovery depends on timing and quantity of carbohydrate** – rapid intake of a large enough amount is needed to maximize glycogen restoration ([
            Carbohydrates and Endurance Exercise: A Narrative Review of a Food First Approach - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10054587/#:~:text=exercise%20event%20to%20ensure%20that,of%20the%20previous%20exercise%20bout)). Thus, a post-marathon recovery plan might include an initial snack (e.g. sports drink or chocolate milk and a banana at the finish) followed by a larger meal (e.g. a rice or pasta-based dish) a bit later.

### Protein  
**Role & Daily Needs:** Protein is essential for muscle repair, remodeling, and recovery in endurance athletes. While running is not as muscle-damaging as heavy resistance exercise, marathon training (especially high mileage and downhill running) does cause muscle fiber breakdown, and adequate protein helps optimize training adaptations. Endurance athletes are advised to consume **approximately 1.2–2.0 g of protein per kg body weight per day** ([
            Nutrition and Supplement Update for the Endurance Athlete: Review and Recommendations - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6628334/#:~:text=The%20AND%2C%20DC%2C%20and%20ACSM,lower%20range%2C%20based%20on%20individual)). This is a higher intake than the general population RDA, reflecting greater need for tissue repair and for supporting lean mass. In practice, **1.5 g/kg/day** is often cited as a reasonable target (e.g. ~105 g/day for a 70 kg runner), with elite runners possibly at the upper end if they are balancing heavy training and lean mass maintenance. Notably, some recreational runners (especially those with low-calorie diets) may under-consume protein, risking suboptimal recovery. Both elites and recreational athletes should ensure each day’s meals collectively meet these protein needs.

**Timing and Distribution:** How protein is distributed across the day matters for maximizing muscle protein synthesis. Rather than one large serving, it’s ideal to split protein into moderate doses. Consensus guidelines recommend **~0.3 g/kg of high-quality protein every 3–5 hours** throughout the day ([
            Nutrition and Supplement Update for the Endurance Athlete: Review and Recommendations - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6628334/#:~:text=match%20at%20L504%20performance%20,8)). For a 70 kg runner, 0.3 g/kg is ~21 g protein per feeding – roughly the amount in 3 eggs or a scoop of whey protein. This pattern ensures a steady supply of amino acids for muscle repair. Marathoners should pay special attention to **post-exercise protein** intake. Consuming ~20–30 g protein soon after a key workout or race (within 30-60 minutes) helps stimulate muscle repair and adaptation ([
            Nutrition and Supplement Update for the Endurance Athlete: Review and Recommendations - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6628334/#:~:text=match%20at%20L504%20performance%20,8)). For example, following a long run, one might have Greek yogurt with fruit, a protein shake, or a tuna sandwich to supply protein along with carbs. Interestingly, ingesting a small amount of protein *before* or *during* exercise has been studied (to reduce muscle damage or supply extra fuel), but for marathons this is generally not necessary and can cause GI distress. The focus should be on pre-loading carbs and then taking protein **after** the run for recovery ([
            Nutrition and Supplement Update for the Endurance Athlete: Review and Recommendations - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6628334/#:~:text=3%E2%80%935%20h%29%20or%200,exercise)). During ultra-endurance events (beyond marathon length), some protein or BCAAs during the race might help minimize muscle breakdown, but for a marathon there’s no strong evidence that mid-race protein improves performance. What is important is **consistent daily intake**: both elites and recreational runners should include protein-rich foods in each meal (e.g. eggs, dairy, lean meat, fish, legumes, tofu) to meet the 1.2–2.0 g/kg goal ([
            Nutrition and Supplement Update for the Endurance Athlete: Review and Recommendations - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6628334/#:~:text=The%20AND%2C%20DC%2C%20and%20ACSM,lower%20range%2C%20based%20on%20individual)). This supports better recovery so the athlete can handle high training volumes. 

**Race-Day Protein:** On the day of competition, protein is not a primary fuel, but a small amount in the pre-race meal can help satiety and provide amino acids to curb muscle breakdown. For instance, having a little protein (10–20 g, such as a small serving of whey or some peanut butter) in the breakfast 2–3h before the marathon is fine, but one should avoid large protein portions that could slow digestion or cause GI upset. During the marathon, most runners consume negligible protein (focus is on carbs and hydration), and that’s fine – the body can rely on stored amino acids for those few hours. After the race, as noted, **protein intake is critical**: aim for ~20 g high-quality protein in the immediate recovery meal to initiate muscle repair ([
            Nutrition and Supplement Update for the Endurance Athlete: Review and Recommendations - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6628334/#:~:text=match%20at%20L504%20performance%20,8)), and continue with regular protein-containing meals/snacks as hunger returns. This will aid in rebuilding any muscle damage from the race and can help immune function as well. 

### Fats  
**Role & Daily Needs:** Dietary fats are a vital component of an endurance athlete’s diet, contributing essential fatty acids for health, aiding in the absorption of fat-soluble vitamins, and providing a dense source of energy. While carbs are the marathoner’s main performance fuel, fats serve as the primary fuel at lower intensities and for longer-duration base training. A common recommendation is that athletes get roughly **20–35% of their total calories from fat**, similar to general healthy eating guidelines. Importantly, **fat should not be overly restricted** – intakes below ~20% of calories are *not* advised for athletes ([
            Nutrition and Supplement Update for the Endurance Athlete: Review and Recommendations - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6628334/#:~:text=match%20at%20L426%20Fat%20Do,race%20if%20GI%20comfort%20concerns)), as very low-fat diets can impair absorption of fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, K) and potentially affect hormone levels. In absolute terms, many marathoners will consume ~1–1.5 g/kg of fat per day (which for a 70 kg runner might be 70–105 g of fat daily, though usually we think in percentage of calories). Both elite and recreational runners should include healthy fats (e.g. nuts, seeds, olive oil, avocado, fatty fish) in their daily diet for overall health and inflammation modulation. These foods provide omega-3 fatty acids and monounsaturated fats that support cardiovascular health and may assist recovery. 

**Fat as Fuel and “Training Low”:** Marathon running relies more on carbohydrate at race pace, but fat is a significant fuel source, especially for longer training runs at moderate intensity. Well-trained athletes become very efficient at oxidizing fat – an adaptation that spares glycogen. In fact, elites typically have such well-developed fat metabolism that even when their glycogen is nearly exhausted after hours of exercise, they can continue at a moderate pace by burning fat and lactate ([
            Nutrition and Supplement Update for the Endurance Athlete: Review and Recommendations - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6628334/#:~:text=outlined%20below,consider%20this%20when%20counseling%20athletes)). This partially explains how an elite can avoid complete collapse even when “running on fumes.” Some endurance athletes experiment with high-fat, low-carb (HFLC) diets or ketogenic diets to further enhance fat oxidation. While HFLC diets do increase fat-burning capacity, they usually *reduce* the ability to utilize carbohydrate at high intensities. Current evidence does not show performance benefits of a long-term high-fat, low-carb diet for marathons ([Nutrition strategies for the marathon : fuel for training and racing - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17465604/#:~:text=restoration%20of%20muscle%20glycogen%20between,likely%20to%20happen%20as%20the)). In fact, chronically low-carb intake can compromise training intensity and lead to slower race times for most runners ([Nutrition strategies for the marathon : fuel for training and racing - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17465604/#:~:text=restoration%20of%20muscle%20glycogen%20between,likely%20to%20happen%20as%20the)). As noted earlier, a periodized approach (occasionally training with low glycogen) can be a tool, but the competition strategy is invariably high carbohydrate (“**train low, race high**” concept) ([
            Nutrition and Supplement Update for the Endurance Athlete: Review and Recommendations - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6628334/#:~:text=70,70)). Therefore, the general advice is to consume adequate fat for health and satiety, but **prioritize carbs** for fueling intense workouts and races.

**Timing – When to Limit Fat:** One scenario where fat intake is consciously limited is around key high-CHO time points, because fat can slow digestion. For example, in the **1–2 days of carb-loading** before a marathon, runners often reduce fat intake (and fiber) to allow room for more carbs and to avoid GI issues ([
            Nutrition and Supplement Update for the Endurance Athlete: Review and Recommendations - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6628334/#:~:text=Fat%20Do%20not%20restrict%20to,race%20if%20GI%20comfort%20concerns)). Similarly, the **pre-race meal** should not be heavy in fat – e.g. avoid greasy foods on race morning, as they delay gastric emptying and could cause discomfort ([
            International Society of Sports Nutrition Position Stand: nutritional considerations for single-stage ultra-marathon training and racing - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6839090/#:~:text=the%20event%20,gut%20discomfort%20during%20the%20race)). But outside of those specific windows, marathoners should eat balanced meals including some fat. There is no need to follow an extremely low-fat diet during the training season; doing so could leave an athlete constantly hungry and even at risk for fat-soluble vitamin deficiencies or inadequate essential fatty acids. **At least ~20% of calories from fat** is recommended ([
            Nutrition and Supplement Update for the Endurance Athlete: Review and Recommendations - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6628334/#:~:text=match%20at%20L426%20Fat%20Do,race%20if%20GI%20comfort%20concerns)), and many athletes do well with ~30% for adequate energy. For instance, a diet of 3,000 kcal for a high-training elite could include ~80 g of fat (which is ~25% of kcal). For a recreational runner eating 2,500 kcal, ~70 g fat (~25%) would be reasonable. Emphasis should be on “quality” fats: nuts, nut butter, olive oil, avocado, oily fish (salmon, sardines) and flax/chia provide beneficial fats and anti-inflammatory omega-3s, which can aid recovery. Saturated fats (butter, fatty meats) can be included in moderation, but ultra-processed high-fat junk foods should be limited as they provide poor nutrient value. In summary, **fat is a necessary part of the marathon diet for health and baseline energy needs**, but intake should be moderated so as not to crowd out carbohydrates. During competition phases, minimize high-fat foods in the meals immediately before running or during the race. 

*Difference between Elite and Recreational Runners:* Generally, macro-nutrient principles apply similarly to elites and recreational runners, but **elite runners** often operate closer to the upper limits of carb intake (both daily and during races) and have nutritionists fine-tuning their plans. **Recreational runners** might not always meet ideal carb targets due to lifestyle or knowledge gaps – for instance, many amateur runners inadvertently eat too little carbohydrate and experience “bonking” mid-race. Similarly, some recreational runners under-eat protein (especially if trying to lose weight concurrently), which can hinder recovery. Elites, on the other hand, tend to be meticulous about protein intake to prevent injuries and promote adaptation. In terms of fat, recreational runners sometimes go too low (in misguided efforts to lose weight quickly) or too high (following fad diets). Elites usually maintain a balanced intake, using fat mainly for general nutrition rather than fuel. A notable difference is gut training: elites regularly practice consuming 60–90 g/h of carbs in training and thus can aggressively fuel on race day, whereas a recreational runner might only manage 30–50 g/h without GI upset. Each individual is unique, but broadly, the **same guidelines (high carbs, moderate protein, moderate fat)** are the starting point – the differences are in fine-tuning quantities to body size and training load. Importantly, any runner – novice or Olympian – will benefit from **fuelling adequately** rather than trying to “run a marathon on fumes.”

## Micronutrients: Key Vitamins and Minerals for Marathoners  

While macronutrients supply energy and building blocks, **micronutrients** (vitamins and minerals) play vital roles in oxygen transport, bone health, muscle contraction, and energy metabolism. Endurance training can increase the demand for certain micronutrients, and deficiencies can impede performance. Marathon runners should aim to meet or exceed the Recommended Dietary Intakes for all vitamins and minerals through a varied, nutrient-dense diet. Here we highlight a few micronutrients that are particularly important for endurance performance and recovery: **iron**, **magnesium**, and **sodium (plus other electrolytes)**. We also briefly note others like calcium, vitamin D, and potassium. These nutrients are critical for both elite and recreational runners, though those without professional guidance (often recreational athletes) should be especially mindful to avoid hidden deficiencies.

### Iron  
**Why It’s Important:** Iron is absolutely crucial for endurance athletes because it’s a core component of hemoglobin and myoglobin, the proteins that carry oxygen in blood and muscle. High aerobic performance depends on robust oxygen delivery to muscles; if iron stores are low, the body’s capacity to transport oxygen drops, leading to fatigue. **Iron deficiency**, even without progressing to anemia, can impair muscle function and limit endurance capacity, affecting performance and training adaptation negatively ([
            Exploring the Relationship between Micronutrients and Athletic Performance: A Comprehensive Scientific Systematic Review of the Literature in Sports Medicine - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10302780/#:~:text=Iron%20deficiency%2C%20whether%20combined%20with,61)). In other words, a marathoner low in iron will struggle to sustain training paces and may feel excessive fatigue. Chronic iron deficiency undermines both performance and the adaptations to training (like increasing VO₂max). 

**Risk Factors for Runners:** Marathoners have several risk factors for iron depletion. Iron is lost through sweat, and runners (especially high-mileage elites) also experience “footstrike hemolysis” – the pounding of feet can break red blood cells in capillaries, leading to iron loss over time. Female runners are at particular risk due to menstrual iron losses and typically lower dietary iron intake. Vegetarians and vegans must be vigilant, as plant-based iron (non-heme iron) has lower bioavailability than heme iron from animal foods. Additionally, heavy training can elevate hepcidin (an iron-regulating hormone) temporarily, which reduces iron absorption in the hours post-exercise. All these factors mean marathoners, especially elites or those with restrictive diets, often have increased iron needs. It is not uncommon for sports dietitians to monitor serum ferritin (iron stores) in elite runners and intervene if levels drop too low.

**Meeting Iron Needs:** The best approach is to consume iron-rich foods regularly. Heme iron sources such as red meat (beef, venison, lamb), poultry, and fish are well-absorbed. Plant sources like beans, lentils, tofu, spinach, and fortified cereals contribute as well; pairing them with vitamin C (e.g. citrus, berries, bell peppers) can enhance non-heme iron absorption. For example, a stir-fry with beef and broccoli or oatmeal with raisins and strawberries can improve iron uptake. The recommended dietary allowance (RDA) for iron is ~18 mg/day for premenopausal women and 8 mg/day for men, but athletes may need more. Many female marathoners target ~20+ mg/day through diet and supplements if needed. **Supplementation:** Iron supplements (ferrous sulfate, etc.) should only be used under guidance when a deficiency is identified. Research shows iron supplementation can improve performance **only if the athlete is iron-deficient**; taking high-dose iron when you are already sufficient won’t boost performance and may cause gut issues ([
            Exploring the Relationship between Micronutrients and Athletic Performance: A Comprehensive Scientific Systematic Review of the Literature in Sports Medicine - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10302780/#:~:text=,149)). In fact, excessive iron can interfere with other minerals (like zinc) and cause oxidative stress. Therefore, runners should get periodic blood checks for ferritin and hemoglobin, especially if they experience fatigue or poor performance. If levels are low, an iron supplement can significantly improve energy and recovery ([
            Exploring the Relationship between Micronutrients and Athletic Performance: A Comprehensive Scientific Systematic Review of the Literature in Sports Medicine - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10302780/#:~:text=Iron%20deficiency%2C%20whether%20combined%20with,Dairy%20products%2C%20sardines%20and%20salmon)). If levels are normal, focus on maintaining a diet with iron-rich foods. Both elite and age-group runners have experienced performance slumps from unrecognized iron deficiency – so this is a **critical micronutrient** to monitor.

### Magnesium  
**Why It’s Important:** Magnesium (Mg) is involved in **hundreds of enzymatic reactions** in the body, including those related to energy production (ATP synthesis) and muscle and nerve function. For endurance athletes, magnesium plays a key role in muscle contraction and relaxation, and it contributes to the structural development of bone. Perhaps most importantly, magnesium is required for steps in oxidative energy metabolism – so if magnesium status is suboptimal, an athlete might experience quicker onset of fatigue. Research indicates that marginal magnesium deficiency can impair exercise performance and amplify the negative consequences of strenuous exercise ([Maximize performance with magnesium! - USA Triathlon](https://www.usatriathlon.org/articles/recovery/maximize-performance-with-magnesium#:~:text=Maximize%20performance%20with%20magnesium%21%20,negative%20consequences%20of%20strenuous%20exercise)). In other words, without enough magnesium, a runner may not be able to perform at their best or recover optimally. Some studies have found a direct correlation between high physical activity levels and increased magnesium requirements ([
            Exploring the Relationship between Micronutrients and Athletic Performance: A Comprehensive Scientific Systematic Review of the Literature in Sports Medicine - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10302780/#:~:text=,and%20found%20a%20direct%20correlation)). This makes sense: athletes lose magnesium through sweat and urine, and their metabolic demand for Mg in working muscles is elevated. 

**Signs of Low Magnesium and Prevalence:** Magnesium deficiency can manifest as muscle cramps, tremors, or excessive soreness, but even without obvious symptoms, many people have inadequate magnesium intake. Athletes may not realize they are insufficient. Magnesium also has a role in modulating inflammation; insufficient magnesium can fail to counteract the pro-inflammatory stress of exercise ([
            Exploring the Relationship between Micronutrients and Athletic Performance: A Comprehensive Scientific Systematic Review of the Literature in Sports Medicine - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10302780/#:~:text=Athletes%20who%20are%20insufficient%20in,increase%20the%20risk%20of%20hypertension)). Additionally, low Mg can contribute to insomnia or poor sleep quality, which further hampers recovery. While full deficiency (hypomagnesemia) is uncommon, even a mild insufficiency could hinder a marathoner’s recovery and performance. Both elites and recreational runners should ensure they meet the **Recommended Intake** (RDA for magnesium is about **400 mg/day for men and 310 mg/day for women** ([
            Exploring the Relationship between Micronutrients and Athletic Performance: A Comprehensive Scientific Systematic Review of the Literature in Sports Medicine - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10302780/#:~:text=Magnesium%20,66))). Notably, some dietary surveys of athletes show suboptimal magnesium intake, especially in those who restrict calories or avoid magnesium-rich foods.

**Food Sources and Strategies:** The good news is that magnesium is widely available in healthy foods. Excellent sources include nuts and seeds (almonds, peanuts, cashews, pumpkin seeds), legumes (beans, lentils), whole grains (brown rice, whole wheat, quinoa), and leafy green vegetables (spinach, kale). For instance, 1 ounce of almonds provides ~80 mg Mg, a cup of cooked spinach ~150 mg, and a cup of black beans ~120 mg. Including these foods daily can easily reach the ~300–400 mg target ([
            Exploring the Relationship between Micronutrients and Athletic Performance: A Comprehensive Scientific Systematic Review of the Literature in Sports Medicine - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10302780/#:~:text=Magnesium%20,66)). A marathoner’s diet rich in whole grains and veggies often covers magnesium, but during periods of heavy training (or if the athlete has a very high sweat rate in hot weather), additional magnesium may be beneficial. Some athletes take magnesium supplements or use electrolyte powders that include magnesium, especially if they experience frequent cramps. There is some evidence that magnesium supplementation in deficient individuals can improve exercise performance ([
            Exploring the Relationship between Micronutrients and Athletic Performance: A Comprehensive Scientific Systematic Review of the Literature in Sports Medicine - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10302780/#:~:text=,and%20found%20a%20direct%20correlation)). However, mega-dosing magnesium is not necessary if diet is adequate – any excess is usually excreted, and extremely high supplements can cause diarrhea (magnesium is a component of some laxatives). A balanced approach is to ensure daily diet provides magnesium, and if lab tests or symptoms suggest low Mg, consider a modest supplement (e.g. magnesium citrate ~200-300 mg). It’s also worth noting magnesium’s interplay with vitamin D and calcium in bone health and muscle function: all need to be sufficient for optimal performance. 

In summary, **magnesium is crucial for marathoners’ energy metabolism and neuromuscular function**. Both elites and recreational runners should consume magnesium-rich whole foods daily. This helps maintain muscle performance and may reduce risk of cramps and excessive post-run soreness. If an athlete’s diet is lacking (for example, some convenience-heavy diets could be low in Mg), correcting that is a priority. Ensuring adequate magnesium will support the high training loads by keeping the body’s enzymes and muscles working efficiently ([
            Exploring the Relationship between Micronutrients and Athletic Performance: A Comprehensive Scientific Systematic Review of the Literature in Sports Medicine - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10302780/#:~:text=,38)).

### Sodium and Electrolytes  
**Why They Matter:** *Electrolytes* – particularly **sodium** – are minerals that maintain fluid balance, nerve conduction, and muscle contractions. Sodium (along with potassium, chloride, magnesium, etc.) is lost in sweat during exercise. Marathon runners can lose a significant amount of sodium in a lengthy race, especially in warm weather or if they are heavy sweaters (some individuals lose >1.5 liters of sweat per hour, each liter containing around 1 g of sodium on average ([
            Nutrition and Supplement Update for the Endurance Athlete: Review and Recommendations - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6628334/#:~:text=during%20exercise%20in%20athletes%20with,sports%20drink%20containing%20sodium%20in)) ([
            Nutrition and Supplement Update for the Endurance Athlete: Review and Recommendations - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6628334/#:~:text=average%20sweat%20rates%20range%20from,sports%20drink%20containing%20sodium%20in))). If these losses are not replaced, blood sodium levels can drop, leading to hyponatremia, or at minimum the runner may suffer muscle cramps, fatigue, or dizziness. **Sodium is the most critical electrolyte to replace during endurance exercise** because it’s lost in the greatest quantity. It helps maintain blood volume and ward off dehydration. Potassium, magnesium, and calcium also play roles in muscle function, but sodium imbalance is the primary concern in long races.

**Hydration and Sodium Strategy:** Both elite and recreational marathoners need a personalized hydration strategy, including electrolyte replacement. However, their approaches may differ: elites often tolerate some dehydration (finishing 2–4% body weight lost is common) to avoid carrying extra fluid weight, and they generally have access to sports drinks and personal bottles with electrolytes during the race. Recreational runners, especially slower ones, are actually at higher risk of *over*-drinking water without enough sodium, which can cause dilutional hyponatremia. In fact, cases of severe hyponatremia have mostly occurred in back-of-the-pack marathoners who consumed large volumes of plain water over 4–6 hours. This can be life-threatening. Therefore, current guidelines emphasize drinking **to thirst** or at a moderate rate, and including sodium to match sweat losses, rather than force-drinking excessive fluids ([

            Nutrition and Supplement Update for the Endurance Athlete: Review and Recommendations - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6628334/#:~:text=400%E2%80%93800%20mL%2Fh%20,content%2C%20intensity%20of%20exercise%2C%20body)). Faster or heavier runners in hot conditions will be on the higher end; slower or lighter runners in cool conditions on the lower end ([
            Nutrition and Supplement Update for the Endurance Athlete: Review and Recommendations - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6628334/#:~:text=match%20at%20L705%20factors,kg%20athlete%20in%20cool%20or)). 

Within that fluid, they recommend **including sodium** for longer races. A typical guideline is around **300–600 mg of sodium per hour** for prolonged exercise ([
            Nutrition and Supplement Update for the Endurance Athlete: Review and Recommendations - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6628334/#:~:text=match%20at%20L726%20commercial%20sports,discussed%20in%20Recovery%20Nutrition%20section)), with higher amounts if the athlete has very salty sweat or is in extreme heat. For example, consuming a sports drink that provides ~200 mg sodium per 8 oz, at a rate of 16–24 oz (0.5–0.75 L) per hour, would yield ~400–600 mg sodium/hour – which is in line with recommendations ([
            Nutrition and Supplement Update for the Endurance Athlete: Review and Recommendations - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6628334/#:~:text=match%20at%20L726%20commercial%20sports,discussed%20in%20Recovery%20Nutrition%20section)). Many commercial sports drinks and gels are formulated with sodium. Additionally, runners who sweat heavily or cramp easily might use salt tablets or electrolyte capsules during the race (each typically contains ~200–300 mg sodium along with other electrolytes). It’s wise to **practice** this in training to fine-tune the amount that maintains performance without causing bloating. 

**Electrolyte Balance and Performance:** Maintaining sodium levels helps preserve **plasma volume** so that the heart can pump blood effectively to muscles and skin (for cooling). If a runner only drinks water and dilutes their sodium, they may experience headaches, nausea, or cramps as nerves and muscles misfire. On the flip side, dehydration (losing too much water and not replacing it) can also hurt performance and increase cardiovascular strain. So it’s a balance – drink enough to attenuate dehydration, but don’t overdrink beyond thirst, and **ensure some electrolytes are coming in** ([
            Nutrition and Supplement Update for the Endurance Athlete: Review and Recommendations - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6628334/#:~:text=illustrated%20in%20the%202007%20ACSM,40)). Elite runners often finish slightly dehydrated but they typically start well-hydrated and drink at aid stations; they are also less prone to hyponatremia because they race faster (less time to overconsume fluid) and they often use sports drinks. Recreational runners should consciously incorporate electrolytes if running over ~2 hours ([
            Nutrition and Supplement Update for the Endurance Athlete: Review and Recommendations - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6628334/#:~:text=environmental%20conditions,and%20the%20average%20sodium)). This could mean alternating water and sports drink, or taking a electrolyte-rich beverage (with ~500–700 mg/L sodium) throughout. 

**Other Electrolytes:** **Potassium** is another electrolyte lost in sweat, though typically less critical to supplement acutely than sodium. Most sports drinks also contain some potassium (e.g. 50–100 mg per serving) which helps with nerve and muscle cell function. Potassium is generally abundant in diet with fruits and vegetables; bananas and oranges, for instance, are known runner snacks high in potassium. As long as a runner’s overall diet has plenty of produce, potassium levels will be maintained. **Magnesium** and **calcium** can also be lost in sweat in small amounts. These are usually replenished in the post-run meal. Some runners take magnesium (as mentioned earlier) especially if they struggle with cramps. Calcium needs (about 1,000–1,300 mg/day) should be met through diet to maintain bone health – this is crucial for marathoners to prevent stress fractures. Not directly performance-enhancing, but ensuring adequate calcium and vitamin D (for absorption) is vital for long-term durability ([

        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10302780/#:~:text=Calcium%20plays%20a%20crucial%20role,63)). 

**Summary of Electrolyte Advice:** In marathon context, focus on **sodium replacement and sensible hydration**. Use sports drinks or salty snacks (some runners take pretzels or salt capsules) during extended runs. Aiming for ~0.5–0.7 g/L of sodium in fluids is a good ballpark. Adjust based on your sweat rate and weather – an athlete with high sweat rate in a hot race may need more (and should consider getting sodium in *ahead* of the race as well, a strategy called pre-loading with a salt solution the evening or morning before to boost fluid retention). Meanwhile, a slower runner in a cold race might just sip sports drink and be fine with the lower end. The ultimate goal is to **finish the marathon well-hydrated but not over-hydrated**, avoiding both dehydration (which hampers performance and can cause heat illness) and hyponatremia (which can cause severe illness) ([
            Nutrition and Supplement Update for the Endurance Athlete: Review and Recommendations - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6628334/#:~:text=match%20at%20L737%20illustrated%20in,40)). By including electrolytes, runners maintain better **performance** (since cardiovascular function and muscle contraction remain optimal) and safety. 

### Other Micronutrients to Note  
- **Calcium & Vitamin D:** Important for bone density and muscle function. Marathoners subject their bones to repetitive stress; adequate calcium (1000 mg/day for adults, higher for teens/masters) and vitamin D (~800–2000 IU/day if levels are low) help prevent stress fractures and support muscle contractions. Female athletes with menstrual irregularities (relative energy deficiency) are at high risk for low bone density – they absolutely need sufficient calcium and D ([
            Exploring the Relationship between Micronutrients and Athletic Performance: A Comprehensive Scientific Systematic Review of the Literature in Sports Medicine - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10302780/#:~:text=Calcium%20plays%20a%20crucial%20role,63)). Dairy products (milk, yogurt), fortified plant milks, leafy greens, and almonds are good calcium sources. Sun exposure and/or supplements help maintain vitamin D, which in turn aids calcium absorption and muscle recovery. 
- **Zinc:** Involved in energy production and immune function. Endurance exercise can deplete zinc; deficiency in zinc can reduce endurance and impair recovery ([Iron, Zinc and Magnesium Nutrition and Athletic Performance | Sports Medicine
        ](https://link.springer.com/article/10.2165/00007256-198805030-00004#:~:text=Evidence%20is%20presented%20that%20both,are%20used%2C%20it%20is%20important)) ([
            Exploring the Relationship between Micronutrients and Athletic Performance: A Comprehensive Scientific Systematic Review of the Literature in Sports Medicine - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10302780/#:~:text=,40)). Most athletes get enough through meat, seafood, whole grains, and nuts. If a runner has frequent illnesses or poor healing, zinc status might be worth checking. The RDA is ~8–11 mg/day. Caution with oversupplementing (excess zinc can cause copper deficiency). 
- **B-Vitamins:** These vitamins (B1, B2, B3, B6, B12, folate, etc.) are cofactors in energy metabolism pathways and red blood cell production. Marathoners have higher needs for B-vitamins due to their elevated energy turnover. Vitamin B12 and folate are particularly important for red blood cell synthesis (like iron). Vegetarians should ensure B12 intake via fortified foods or a supplement since B12 is only in animal products. Generally, a balanced diet with whole grains, vegetables, and lean proteins provides B-vitamins; a daily multivitamin is an option if diet is limited. Inadequate B-vitamin status can reduce the body’s ability to produce energy and carry oxygen, so it’s wise to meet 100% of daily needs ([16.5: Sports Nutrition - Medicine LibreTexts](https://med.libretexts.org/Under_Construction/Purgatory/Book%3A_Human_Nutrition_1e_(University_of_Hawaii)/16%3A_Performance_Nutrition/16.05%3A_Sports_Nutrition#:~:text=16.5%3A%20Sports%20Nutrition%20,are%20needed%20in%20great%20amounts)). 
- **Antioxidants:** Vitamins C and E, beta-carotene, and selenium are antioxidants that help combat exercise-induced oxidative stress. Marathon training generates free radicals that can contribute to muscle soreness and inflammation. A diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and nuts usually provides ample antioxidants to support recovery. For example, berries (vitamin C), almonds (vitamin E), and tomatoes or carrots (beta-carotene) are all beneficial. High-dose antioxidant supplements are **not** recommended during training – research shows that mega-doses of C or E can blunt some training adaptations by interfering with the body’s natural oxidative signals ([
            Nutrition and Supplement Update for the Endurance Athlete: Review and Recommendations - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6628334/#:~:text=In%20reality%20there%20are%20numerous,injured%20athletes%20and%20are%20steadily)). Thus, **food first** is the mantra: eat colorful produce to get a natural mix of antioxidants. This will support the immune system (important for marathoners under heavy training stress) and aid in repair without negating training gains. 

In summary, micronutrient adequacy is a cornerstone of a marathoner’s nutrition plan. Elites often work with dietitians to ensure things like iron and vitamin D are monitored and optimized, giving them a performance edge. Recreational runners should likewise pay attention to these “small” nutrients – getting blood work if possible, taking a multivitamin or specific supplements if a true deficiency is present (e.g. iron or vitamin D), and otherwise focusing on a nutrient-dense diet. A well-rounded daily diet – high in vegetables, fruits, whole grains, lean proteins, and dairy or fortified alternatives – will naturally cover most micronutrient needs and keep the marathoner’s body functioning at its best.

## Evidence-Based Supplements for Endurance Performance  

Beyond whole foods and standard nutrients, certain **ergogenic aids** (performance-enhancing supplements) have strong scientific support for use in endurance sports like marathoning. Here we detail several supplements with evidence-based benefits: **caffeine, creatine, electrolytes (sodium supplementation), beta-alanine, and nitrates (beetroot juice)**. These have been researched extensively and, when used appropriately, can provide a competitive edge or assist in meeting nutrition needs. It’s important to note that individual responses vary, and supplements should be tested in training before race day. Also, supplements *supplement* a good diet – they don’t compensate for poor eating. Both elite and recreational runners use these aids, though access and acceptance may vary (e.g. nearly all elite marathoners strategically use caffeine, while a recreational runner might or might not). We will describe each and highlight any differences in how elites vs. recreational runners might approach them.

### Caffeine  
**How It Works:** Caffeine is one of the most well-proven performance enhancers in endurance sports. It is a stimulant that affects the central nervous system and muscles. By blocking adenosine receptors in the brain, caffeine reduces the perception of effort and fatigue, allowing a runner to maintain a hard pace longer before feeling exhausted ([
            Nutrition and Supplement Update for the Endurance Athlete: Review and Recommendations - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6628334/#:~:text=Caffeine%2C%20a%20popular%20supplement%20in,and%20increases%20thermogenesis)) ([
            Nutrition and Supplement Update for the Endurance Athlete: Review and Recommendations - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6628334/#:~:text=,a%20greater%20ergogenic%20effect%20than)). It also increases the release of adrenaline, which can improve alertness and perhaps stimulate a greater release of fatty acids from fat stores (the theory being it might *spare glycogen* slightly, although its glycogen-sparing effect is minor at marathon intensities). Caffeine can also directly enhance muscle fiber recruitment and calcium release in muscle cells, improving muscle contractility ([
            Nutrition and Supplement Update for the Endurance Athlete: Review and Recommendations - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6628334/#:~:text=acts%20as%20a%20stimulant%20to,This%20dosing%20can%20improve)) ([
            Nutrition and Supplement Update for the Endurance Athlete: Review and Recommendations - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6628334/#:~:text=%CE%B2,practical%20importance%20is%20the%20synergistic)). The net result is improved endurance performance – typically seen as the ability to sustain a given speed longer or to finish a time trial faster. Countless studies and meta-analyses confirm that moderate doses of caffeine increase time-to-exhaustion and reduce race times in events from 5K up to marathon. 

**Usage Guidelines:** The consensus dose for performance enhancement is **3–6 mg of caffeine per kg body weight**, taken about **30–90 minutes before** exercise ([
            Nutrition and Supplement Update for the Endurance Athlete: Review and Recommendations - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6628334/#:~:text=,a%20greater%20ergogenic%20effect%20than)). For a 70 kg runner, this is roughly 210–420 mg of caffeine – equivalent to about 2–4 cups of brewed coffee, or a couple of caffeine pills. Taking caffeine about an hour pre-race allows blood levels to peak during the marathon. Many runners consume caffeine via coffee (for example, an elite might have a strong cup of coffee ~60 min before the gun) or via specialized products (caffeine tablets or caffeinated gels). It’s wise to **start at the low end** (3 mg/kg) and see if that provides a benefit without side effects. Research shows little additional benefit beyond 5-6 mg/kg; higher doses just increase risk of jitters and GI upset ([
            Nutrition and Supplement Update for the Endurance Athlete: Review and Recommendations - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6628334/#:~:text=Higher%20caffeine%20doses%20of%209,considered%20above%20the%20doping%20threshold)). In fact, doses above ~9 mg/kg can produce *negative* effects (anxiety, nausea, heart palpitations, insomnia) with no further performance gain ([
            Nutrition and Supplement Update for the Endurance Athlete: Review and Recommendations - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6628334/#:~:text=Higher%20caffeine%20doses%20of%209,considered%20above%20the%20doping%20threshold)). Most guidelines cap caffeine at ~400-450 mg total for safety and diminishing returns. For context, 3 mg/kg for a 60 kg recreational runner is ~180 mg (the amount in a large cup of coffee or a caffeine gel plus cola during race). **Lower doses (1–2 mg/kg)** can also be beneficial for those sensitive to caffeine – even ~100 mg caffeine (equivalent to an espresso or caffeinated gel) has shown to improve alertness and performance in studies ([
            Nutrition and Supplement Update for the Endurance Athlete: Review and Recommendations - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6628334/#:~:text=complications%20such%20as%20water,77)). 

**During the Race:** In marathons, some runners take additional caffeine during the race to maintain its effects, especially toward the later miles. Caffeine has a half-life of ~5 hours, so a pre-race dose usually covers a marathon duration for elites. Recreational runners out there for 4+ hours might consider a “caffeine top-up” mid-race – e.g. ~50–100 mg around 20 km (perhaps via a caffeinated energy gel or drink). Studies have found that a mid-ride low dose of caffeine (~1.5 mg/kg at the 80-minute mark) helped cyclists in the second half of a ~3 hour effort ([
            Nutrition and Supplement Update for the Endurance Athlete: Review and Recommendations - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6628334/#:~:text=Furthermore%2C%20caffeine%20may%20also%20be,trial)). Thus, a runner could consume, say, 100 mg at mile 15–18 to sharpen focus and push through fatigue. One must be cautious not to overdo total intake, and again, test in training (some people get stomach issues if they take caffeine on an empty stomach or while already straining). Caffeine gum or strips that dissolve in the mouth are quick ways some athletes dose late in a race because they absorb faster buccally (through cheek membranes).

**Performance Benefits:** Caffeine reliably offers a modest but significant boost. It can improve **time-trial performance and endurance capacity** – for example, one meta-analysis found ~2–4% improvement in endurance time with caffeine ([
            Nutrition and Supplement Update for the Endurance Athlete: Review and Recommendations - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6628334/#:~:text=,a%20greater%20ergogenic%20effect%20than)). That could translate to knocking several minutes off a marathon for a mid-pack runner or giving an elite the extra edge to dip under a barrier. It also enhances mental alertness, which helps with race concentration and pacing. Interestingly, when taken with carbohydrates, caffeine has a synergistic effect: co-ingesting caffeine plus carbs during exercise improves performance more than carbs alone ([
            Nutrition and Supplement Update for the Endurance Athlete: Review and Recommendations - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6628334/#:~:text=30%E2%80%9390%20min%20prior%20to%20exercise,authors%20question%20if%20practically%20this)). Marathoners often benefit from this synergy by using caffeinated sports gels or drinks (providing both fuel and stimulant together). 

**Individual Differences:** People vary in caffeine sensitivity. Genetic factors (like variations in the CYP1A2 enzyme or adenosine receptor genes) can make some individuals “fast” or “slow” metabolizers, affecting how strongly caffeine works or if it causes jitters. About 10–15% of people feel no performance benefit from caffeine (“non-responders”). Most, however, do benefit. Habitual caffeine users (daily coffee drinkers) still get performance gains, though there was debate on whether one should abstain for a few days prior to an event to “reset” sensitivity. Current evidence suggests that even if you regularly consume caffeine, an acute dose pre-exercise will help – you don’t need to withdraw and suffer through a caffeine headache in race week ([
            Nutrition and Supplement Update for the Endurance Athlete: Review and Recommendations - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6628334/#:~:text=Traditionally%2C%20there%20has%20been%20a,trial%20performance%20to%20an%20acute)) ([
            Nutrition and Supplement Update for the Endurance Athlete: Review and Recommendations - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6628334/#:~:text=trial%20performance%20,102)). That said, extremely high habitual intake might blunt the effect slightly over time. 

**Side Notes and Caution:** Caffeine was once on the Olympic banned list above a certain urine concentration, but it is no longer banned (though *very* high doses could still flag doping tests or disqualify in NCAA sports). Standard marathon use is well below any dangerous level. Key cautions: too much caffeine can cause **GI distress**, which is the last thing a runner wants mid-race. It’s a diuretic in large doses at rest, but during exercise caffeine does not notably dehydrate you – studies show it doesn’t cause excessive urine output while running ([
            Nutrition and Supplement Update for the Endurance Athlete: Review and Recommendations - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6628334/#:~:text=,endurance%20cycling%20and%20running%20research)). Still, chasing caffeine with water or sports drink is wise. Also, if taken late in the day (for an afternoon race), it might disrupt sleep afterwards. For an early morning marathon this isn’t a concern (you’ll be done before noon). 

**Elite vs Recreational Use:** Virtually all elite marathoners leverage caffeine – either through coffee, tea, or pharmacological sources. It’s part of their race routine. Recreational runners can equally benefit: something as simple as an energy gel with 50 mg caffeine at mile 20 can subjectively “give a boost” when hitting the wall. Elites have fine-tuned dosing (e.g. some will take 200–300 mg before the race and maybe another 100 mg late-race if needed). Recreational runners should at least consider using caffeine unless they know they’re very sensitive to it. It’s inexpensive, legal, and effective. As one review succinctly put it, **3–6 mg/kg caffeine ~1 hour pre-exercise improves endurance performance** and vigilance ([
            Nutrition and Supplement Update for the Endurance Athlete: Review and Recommendations - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6628334/#:~:text=,a%20greater%20ergogenic%20effect%20than)). Just avoid going overboard – more is not better beyond a point ([
            Nutrition and Supplement Update for the Endurance Athlete: Review and Recommendations - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6628334/#:~:text=Higher%20caffeine%20doses%20of%209,considered%20above%20the%20doping%20threshold)). With sensible use, caffeine is a proven friend to the marathoner, taking a little of the sting out of those 26.2 miles.

### Creatine  
**What It Is:** Creatine monohydrate is a well-known supplement mostly associated with strength and power sports. It works by increasing the stores of phosphocreatine in muscles, which helps rapidly regenerate ATP (energy currency) during short, intense efforts. At first glance, creatine might not seem relevant to marathoning, a predominantly aerobic endurance event. However, emerging research shows that creatine can have *indirect* benefits for endurance athletes as well – particularly by improving high-intensity efforts within endurance races (like surges or sprint finishes) and by aiding recovery and muscle glycogen storage.

**Mechanisms for Endurance:** When an endurance athlete supplements with creatine, they typically increase muscle creatine and phosphocreatine content by ~15–20%. This doesn’t directly make one run longer on its own, but it can enhance the capacity for **repeated high-intensity bursts**. In a marathon, this might come into play during hill surges, passing moves, or the final kick to the finish. A narrative review in 2023 noted that creatine mostly helps endurance performances that require **multiple surges in intensity or a strong end spurt**, which are indeed *race-defining moments* in competitive events ([
            Creatine supplementation and endurance performance: surges and sprints to win the race - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10132248/#:~:text=effects%2C%20particularly%20in%20weight,mixed%3B%20however%2C%20creatine%20supplementation%20appears)). Essentially, if a marathon involves a tactical burst (as in elite competitions) or if the runner wants the ability to kick hard at the end of 26 miles, creatine could be beneficial. Moreover, creatine supplementation has been found to **increase time to exhaustion during high-intensity endurance** activities by boosting the anaerobic work capacity ([
            Creatine supplementation and endurance performance: surges and sprints to win the race - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10132248/#:~:text=effects%2C%20particularly%20in%20weight,mixed%3B%20however%2C%20creatine%20supplementation%20appears)). So in a long run that has intermittent faster segments, creatine-loaded muscles might fatigue less quickly during those intense segments.

Another benefit of creatine for endurance athletes is its effect on **glycogen**. When creatine is taken along with a high-carbohydrate diet, it has been shown to enhance glycogen storage in muscle ([
            Creatine supplementation and endurance performance: surges and sprints to win the race - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10132248/#:~:text=co,In%20contrast%2C%20creatine)). One mechanism is that creatine, by pulling water into muscle cells, can indirectly signal for greater glycogen synthesis. Studies have demonstrated that creatine loading (e.g. 5 days of 20 g/day) can increase muscle glycogen content more than carbs alone ([
            Creatine supplementation and endurance performance: surges and sprints to win the race - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10132248/#:~:text=Creatine%20supplementation%20also%20facilitates%20the,cycled%20to%20exhaustion%20at%2070)) ([

Glycogen, of course, is the endurance athlete’s primary fuel. So a marathoner using creatine during carb-loading might end up with “super-compensated” glycogen stores – potentially an edge in energy availability. Creatine also appears to **lower inflammation and oxidative stress** following exhaustive exercise ([
            Creatine supplementation and endurance performance: surges and sprints to win the race - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10132248/#:~:text=co,In%20contrast%2C%20creatine)), which could improve recovery between hard training sessions. There’s even some evidence it might enhance mitochondrial biogenesis (the creation of new mitochondria) in the long term ([
            Creatine supplementation and endurance performance: surges and sprints to win the race - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10132248/#:~:text=nuances%20within%20the%20literature,bearing%20activities.%20Overall%2C%20creatine)), though that’s still being studied. 

**The Downside – Weight Gain:** The main concern with creatine for runners is that it typically causes a small increase in body mass, on the order of 1–2 kg (2–5 lbs), mainly due to increased water retention in muscles. In weight-bearing endurance sports, extra mass can be a disadvantage because it raises the energy cost of running. For an elite vying for every second, adding even 1 kg might slow their pace slightly on uphills or increase impact forces. This is likely why creatine is not universally used by all marathoners. However, some of that initial weight gain can be mitigated by timing (e.g. loading creatine early in a training cycle, then tapering off before race day if weight is an issue). And the benefits might outweigh the weight cost if the runner significantly improves their finishing kick or recovery. A review concluded that while creatine’s weight gain could **offset** some benefits in weight-bearing activities, the **net effect can still be positive** if it allows for higher quality training or better surges ([
            Creatine supplementation and endurance performance: surges and sprints to win the race - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10132248/#:~:text=content%2C%20an%20important%20fuel%20to,that%20require%20multiple%20surges%20in)). 

**Usage and Protocol:** The standard way to take creatine is either a **loading phase** (20 g/day split into 4 doses for 5–7 days, then 3–5 g/day maintenance) or simply a daily low dose (5 g/day for ~4 weeks to reach saturation). Either achieves full muscle creatine stores. For endurance athletes, a more gradual approach (3–5 g/day) may avoid sudden weight gain and GI discomfort. Many will cycle it: e.g. use it in heavy training blocks to help with cross-training or interval workouts, then possibly stop a week or two before racing if concerned about weight (creatine’s benefits on muscle don’t immediately vanish, and stopping can shed a bit of water weight). 

**Performance Evidence:** Direct studies on creatine and marathon performance are limited. However, in sports like cycling, creatine has helped in scenarios like a sprint after prolonged cycling. One analysis notes **mixed results on time-trial performance** – some studies show no improvement in pure steady-state endurance, which makes sense ([

        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10132248/#:~:text=effects%2C%20particularly%20in%20weight,mixed%3B%20however%2C%20creatine%20supplementation%20appears)). But importantly, **creatine appears more effective for performance when explosive efforts are required during endurance exercise** ([
            Creatine supplementation and endurance performance: surges and sprints to win the race - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10132248/#:~:text=effects%2C%20particularly%20in%20weight,mixed%3B%20however%2C%20creatine%20supplementation%20appears)). It can also increase the quality of interval training sessions (by allowing slightly higher power output or more repetitions before fatigue). Over weeks, that could translate to better fitness gains. Creatine’s recovery benefits (less muscle damage, etc.) mean an athlete might handle higher training loads – indirectly boosting endurance. 

For recreational runners, creatine might help if they also engage in gym training or high-intensity interval runs as part of their program, by improving those workouts. For older runners (masters athletes), creatine can help counter age-related muscle loss and improve training adaptations, which may indirectly aid endurance capacity. Additionally, creatine has cognitive benefits (improved memory and possibly reduced mental fatigue), which could be a minor bonus in long races. 

**Bottom Line:** Creatine is a **safe, well-researched supplement** that could offer marathoners benefits in glycogen storage, high-intensity bursts, and recovery ([
            Creatine supplementation and endurance performance: surges and sprints to win the race - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10132248/#:~:text=nuances%20within%20the%20literature,intensity%20endurance)) ([
            Creatine supplementation and endurance performance: surges and sprints to win the race - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10132248/#:~:text=effects%2C%20particularly%20in%20weight,mixed%3B%20however%2C%20creatine%20supplementation%20appears)). The trade-off is potential water-weight gain. Many elite marathoners do not use creatine routinely, but some do – especially those who incorporate a lot of speedwork or have track racing seasons as well. Recreational runners might try creatine during training to see how their body responds. If they find their weight stays stable and they feel stronger in workouts, it could be kept in their regimen. If they bloat or feel heavy, they might drop it pre-race. **Creatine does not directly make you run faster for 26 miles**, but by allowing you to *train* a bit harder and perhaps finish stronger, it can indirectly improve marathon performance. As one paper summarized: *“Overall, creatine supplementation increases time to exhaustion during high-intensity endurance activities... and appears to be more effective at improving performances that require multiple surges in intensity and/or end spurts.”* ([
            Creatine supplementation and endurance performance: surges and sprints to win the race - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10132248/#:~:text=effects%2C%20particularly%20in%20weight,mixed%3B%20however%2C%20creatine%20supplementation%20appears)). This suggests it’s more of a tool for well-trained runners looking for that extra edge in specific aspects of their race or training.

### Electrolytes (Salt Supplementation)  
*Note:* We’ve covered electrolytes in the micronutrient section, but it’s worth reiterating here as a “supplement” strategy because taking electrolyte products (salt tablets, sports drinks, etc.) during races is a form of supplementation crucial for performance and safety. 

**Why:** During a marathon, especially in warm conditions, **sodium loss** can be substantial. Supplementing electrolytes is evidence-based to prevent hyponatremia and maintain performance in events over ~2 hours ([
            Nutrition and Supplement Update for the Endurance Athlete: Review and Recommendations - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6628334/#:~:text=environmental%20conditions,and%20the%20average%20sodium)). The **ACSM and other sports bodies recommend** that athletes consume fluids with sodium during prolonged exercise to replace at least part of what is lost ([
            Nutrition and Supplement Update for the Endurance Athlete: Review and Recommendations - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6628334/#:~:text=environmental%20conditions,and%20the%20average%20sodium)). This is not about performance enhancement in the sense of making you faster than normal; rather, it’s about preventing decline in performance due to dehydration or electrolyte imbalances. In a way, electrolyte supplementation is a necessary component of an optimal marathon fueling plan, just as carbs are.

**How:** As mentioned, aiming for about **300–600 mg sodium per hour** is a general guideline ([
            Nutrition and Supplement Update for the Endurance Athlete: Review and Recommendations - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6628334/#:~:text=match%20at%20L726%20commercial%20sports,discussed%20in%20Recovery%20Nutrition%20section)), which typically means drinking a sports beverage or using electrolyte capsules. Most marathon-oriented sports drinks provide sodium (e.g. Gatorade Endurance formula, which has ~18 g carbs and ~300 mg sodium per 8 oz cup). A runner could rely on the sports drink for some or all of their carb intake. For example, drinking ~16 oz per hour of Gatorade Endurance would give ~36 g carbs and ~600 mg sodium per hour. If they also take a gel with ~20–25 g, that totals ~55–60 g/hour – a solid fueling rate ([Contemporary Nutrition Strategies to Optimize Performance in Distance Runners and Race Walkers - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30747558/#:~:text=CHO,cooling%20strategies%20may%20provide%20a)). Some athletes prefer liquid nutrition as it may digest even faster; others like a combo to avoid flavor fatigue. **Example Plan:** Drink 1 cup (~4 oz) of sports drink at every aid station (if they are every 2 miles, that’s ~8 oz per ~20–25 min for a 4 hr marathoner, so roughly 20 oz/hour, ~45 g carb/hour). Combined with maybe a gel every 60–75 min, that could reach ~60+ g/hour. The combination of glucose and fructose in many drinks/gels allows better uptake (multiple transportable carbs). 

**Products and Choices:** Common electrolyte supplements include sports drinks (e.g. Gatorade, Powerade, Tailwind, etc.), electrolyte gels (some energy gels are higher in sodium), salt sticks/capsules, or even savory options. Some runners like pretzels or pickle juice in ultras – those are high in sodium and have anecdotal support for cramp relief. In a standard marathon, sticking to sports drink at aid stations is usually sufficient for most runners. However, those who don’t like the provided drink might carry their own electrolyte concentrate. Some marathons have started offering salt packets or broth at later stations for slower runners. If you know you sweat salt (visible salt crystals on skin or gear, or you experience muscle cramps), plan to ingest the higher end of sodium (closer to 600+ mg/h). An easy rule is to **ensure your during-race fluids have sodium** – if you carry just water, include salt capsules (~200–300 mg each) to take every 30–60 min. Post-race, consume salty snacks or drinks to speed rehydration (e.g. pretzels, soup, salted crackers, V8 juice). *Elites* meticulously include sodium in their drinks (the ACSM suggests ~0.5–0.7 g/L fluid ([
            Nutrition and Supplement Update for the Endurance Athlete: Review and Recommendations - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6628334/#:~:text=match%20at%20L726%20commercial%20sports,discussed%20in%20Recovery%20Nutrition%20section)), and many elite bottles are prepared to that spec or higher). *Recreational* runners should not ignore salt either; many mid-packers end up hyponatremic not from lack of salt intake per se, but from over-drinking low-sodium fluids. So the practical advice is: **drink to thirst, and make sure most fluids have electrolytes**. 

**Performance Aspect:** By maintaining electrolyte balance, you sustain better muscle function and avoid cramping related to electrolyte deficits ([
            Nutrition and Supplement Update for the Endurance Athlete: Review and Recommendations - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6628334/#:~:text=environmental%20conditions,and%20the%20average%20sodium)). Note that muscle cramps have complex causes (neuromuscular fatigue is a major factor), but salty supplements have been shown to help runners who are “salty sweaters” or cramp-prone ([
            Nutrition and Supplement Update for the Endurance Athlete: Review and Recommendations - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6628334/#:~:text=match%20at%20L1017%20sweaters%2C%E2%80%9D%20training,not%20show%20any%20additional%20rehydration)). Proper hydration with sodium also keeps blood volume up, supporting cardiac output and cooling (sweat production). In short, electrolyte supplementation helps you **stay closer to peak performance for longer** in a marathon by preventing the decline associated with dehydration or hyponatremia. 

### Beta-Alanine  
**What It Is:** Beta-alanine is a non-essential amino acid that, when ingested, helps raise levels of *carnosine* in muscle. Carnosine is an important intracellular buffer – it soaks up hydrogen ions (H+) that are produced during high-intensity exercise. By buffering H+, carnosine delays the drop in muscle pH (acidosis) that contributes to fatigue. Beta-alanine supplementation is well-known to improve performance in high-intensity exercise bouts lasting ~1 to 10 minutes, such as 800m to 1500m runs or rowing events ([
            Beta-Alanine Supplementation Improved 10-km Running Time Trial in Physically Active Adults - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6092497/#:~:text=A%20meta,and%20the%20majority%20of%20these)). Its relevance to a marathon is less direct, since a marathon is usually run below the lactate threshold (you’re not accumulating huge lactate and H+ until maybe the very end or during surges). However, there are potential benefits in long-duration events that include varying intensities or in individuals who tend to accumulate lactate at marathon race pace (for instance, less trained runners who run at a higher relative intensity).

**Evidence for Endurance:** The evidence for beta-alanine in events beyond 30 minutes is mixed and still emerging. The **majority of beta-alanine studies** show efficacy in efforts of 1–4 minutes (high lactate scenarios) ([
            Beta-Alanine Supplementation Improved 10-km Running Time Trial in Physically Active Adults - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6092497/#:~:text=A%20meta,and%20the%20majority%20of%20these)). For continuous exercises longer than 25–30 min, results have been inconsistent ([
            Beta-Alanine Supplementation Improved 10-km Running Time Trial in Physically Active Adults - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6092497/#:~:text=and%20intramuscular%20H%2B%20accumulation,on%20performance%20beyond%2025%20min)). That said, a few studies have hinted at benefits: one study found beta-alanine improved a 10 km running time trial (which took ~1 hour for subjects) and was associated with lower lactate concentrations afterward ([
            Beta-Alanine Supplementation Improved 10-km Running Time Trial in Physically Active Adults - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6092497/#:~:text=To%20our%20knowledge%2C%20this%20was,supplementation%2C%20with%20lower%20lactate%20concentration)) ([
            Beta-Alanine Supplementation Improved 10-km Running Time Trial in Physically Active Adults - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6092497/#:~:text=showing%20an%20association%20between%20lower,to%20lower%20blood%20lactate%20accumulation)). This suggests beta-alanine might help runners clear or utilize lactate better even in a prolonged effort, thereby slightly improving performance. Another angle: beta-alanine could aid during parts of a marathon where intensity spikes – for example, climbing a hill or a finishing kick, where localized acidosis in fast-twitch fibers could otherwise force a slowdown. By buffering that, the athlete might sustain the effort a bit longer.

A meta-analysis noted that beta-alanine had **small but significant performance effects in high-intensity sustained events, with an average 2–3% improvement in recreational athletes, and ~0.5–1% in elite athletes** ([
	An update on beta-alanine supplementation for athletes
](http://www.gssiweb.org/sports-science-exchange/article/an-update-on-beta-alanine-supplementation-for-athletes#:~:text=%2A%20Two%20meta,1.0%25%20in%20elite%20athletes)). This indicates two things: (1) any performance gain is modest (not game-changing like carbs or caffeine, but potentially the difference of 30–90 seconds in a marathon for a recreational runner), and (2) less trained individuals seem to benefit more, likely because elites are already very well adapted (higher muscle carnosine from training and diet) ([
	An update on beta-alanine supplementation for athletes
](http://www.gssiweb.org/sports-science-exchange/article/an-update-on-beta-alanine-supplementation-for-athletes#:~:text=%2A%20Two%20meta,1.0%25%20in%20elite%20athletes)). Indeed, well-trained athletes may naturally have higher baseline carnosine in muscle, so supplementing gives them a smaller relative boost. 

For marathoners, beta-alanine might be more attractive to those who also do shorter races or a lot of tempo/speed training, as it can improve those sessions. If a recreational marathoner also runs 5Ks or 10Ks, beta-alanine could help across their racing profile. For an elite purely focused on marathons, it’s a bit more debatable – some elites do use beta-alanine (especially if they anticipate surges in pace or just want any small edge). Since beta-alanine is not expensive and is safe (aside from harmless tingling skin sensations called paresthesia when dosing, which can be managed by splitting doses), some marathoners take it as “insurance” for those hard parts of the race. 

**How to Use:** Beta-alanine must be taken consistently over time to load muscles with carnosine. A typical regimen is **4–6 grams of beta-alanine per day, split into 2–3 doses, for at least 4–6 weeks**. This can raise muscle carnosine by ~40-80%. After loading, a maintenance dose of ~1.5–2 g/day can sustain levels. Benefits generally kick in after a few weeks once carnosine is elevated. So this is not an acute supplement you take on race morning (it doesn’t work that way). It’s more akin to creatine – a chronic loading supplement. Many athletes will do a 2-month beta-alanine cycle leading up to their competitive season. 

**Performance Outcomes:** With effective loading, beta-alanine can **increase endurance capacity** in efforts near the lactate threshold. Some studies show it delays fatigue by allowing a higher threshold of H+ accumulation. In a marathon, if a runner in the final 10K is flirting with lactate buildup (as they fatigue, even marathon pace can start generating more lactate due to muscle fiber recruitment changes), having higher muscle carnosine might stave off that dreaded heavy-leg feeling for a bit longer. Additionally, marathons often involve **sprinting at the finish** – whether an elite kicking for a win, or a recreational runner trying to beat a time goal in the final straight. Beta-alanine could make that sprint finish more effective by buffering the rapid acid production in those fast-twitch fibers.

**Research summary:** It’s fair to say beta-alanine is **less crucial** to marathon performance than carbohydrates or caffeine, but it is supported by enough evidence in endurance contexts to be considered. The International Society of Sports Nutrition classifies beta-alanine as a Group A supplement (strong evidence for specific performance benefits). The magnitude of effect is generally *small*, but for serious athletes small improvements count. Recreational runners might see a slightly bigger bump (2–3% better high-intensity performance) than elites (~1%), as noted in meta-analysis ([
	An update on beta-alanine supplementation for athletes
](http://www.gssiweb.org/sports-science-exchange/article/an-update-on-beta-alanine-supplementation-for-athletes#:~:text=%2A%20Two%20meta,1.0%25%20in%20elite%20athletes)). Over 26 miles, even 1% improvement is ~2–3 minutes for a 3:30 marathoner – potentially meaningful. Moreover, beta-alanine has additive effects with other buffers like sodium bicarbonate (though bicarb is hard to use in a marathon due to GI side effects).

**Considerations:** Beta-alanine is very safe. The main side effect, a tingling sensation (paresthesia), occurs if one takes a large dose (like >800–1000 mg at once). This can be mitigated by using sustained-release formulations or taking smaller doses throughout the day. Some users find this tingle unpleasant, others don’t mind. It fades as the body adapts. If a runner tries beta-alanine, they should start at maybe 1.6 g twice a day and build up, taking with meals if needed. 

**Elite vs Recreational Use:** Many elite mid-distance runners use beta-alanine; some marathoners at the pro level may or may not – it’s not as ubiquitous as caffeine. Recreational athletes who have performance goals and are already nailing the basics (diet, training, hydration) could consider it for an extra edge. If someone is purely running for completion or fun, beta-alanine is likely unnecessary. But for those chasing a PR, it could be part of the supplement regimen. It’s worth noting that beta-alanine is not an overnight miracle – the athlete needs to commit to a regimen well before the race. If a runner cannot be consistent with pills or powders for weeks, this might not be for them.

In conclusion, **beta-alanine supplementation can increase muscle buffering capacity, which is beneficial primarily for high-intensity exercise bouts**. Its direct impact on a marathon is subtle, but it might help during intensive segments and contribute to overall endurance by reducing lactate accumulation ([
            Beta-Alanine Supplementation Improved 10-km Running Time Trial in Physically Active Adults - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6092497/#:~:text=showing%20an%20association%20between%20lower,to%20lower%20blood%20lactate%20accumulation)). Studies report a few percent performance improvement in moderately trained runners with beta-alanine ([
	An update on beta-alanine supplementation for athletes
](http://www.gssiweb.org/sports-science-exchange/article/an-update-on-beta-alanine-supplementation-for-athletes#:~:text=%2A%20Two%20meta,1.0%25%20in%20elite%20athletes)), with lesser effects in highly trained. Therefore, it’s an option in the toolkit for marathoners seeking comprehensive gains. As always, test it in training – see if you notice improvements in tempo runs or shorter races after a month on beta-alanine. If yes, it likely is doing something positive; if not, one might choose to allocate resources elsewhere. 

### Nitrates (Beetroot Juice)  
**What It Is:** Nitrate (NO₃⁻) supplementation, commonly in the form of **beetroot juice** or concentrated beet shots, has emerged in the last decade as a popular endurance ergogenic aid. Nitrates in food (like beetroot, spinach, arugula, celery) are converted in the body to **nitric oxide (NO)**, a signaling molecule that causes blood vessels to dilate and helps regulate muscle efficiency. The discovery that dietary nitrate can enhance exercise performance – notably via a landmark 2009 study with cyclists – led to a surge of research. In endurance sports, nitrate supplementation is shown to **reduce the oxygen cost of submaximal exercise and improve exercise tolerance**, essentially making your muscles more efficient ([
            Nutrition and Supplement Update for the Endurance Athlete: Review and Recommendations - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6628334/#:~:text=inorganic%20nitrate%20%28NO3%E2%88%92%29,32%2C51%20%2C%2073%2C53)). By requiring slightly less O₂ for the same output, an athlete can either go a bit faster for a given effort or sustain a given pace longer before fatigue.

**Benefits for Marathoners:** The primary benefit of nitrates is improved **running economy** – your body uses oxygen more economically. Studies have found that after nitrate supplementation, athletes could exercise at a given workload with ~3-5% less oxygen consumption, and some see improved time-to-exhaustion or time-trial performance ([
            Nutrition and Supplement Update for the Endurance Athlete: Review and Recommendations - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6628334/#:~:text=oxide%20has%20numerous%20bodily%20effects,32%2C51%20%2C%2073%2C53)). For a marathoner, better running economy directly translates to performance: think of it like getting slightly better gas mileage on your aerobic “engine.” If you save some energy throughout the race, you have more left for the latter miles. Research has shown improvements in events ranging from 5 km to 10 km time trials with beetroot juice, especially in moderately trained individuals ([
            Nutrition and Supplement Update for the Endurance Athlete: Review and Recommendations - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6628334/#:~:text=respiration%20and%20biogenesis%2C%20glucose%20uptake%2C,32%2C51%20%2C%2073%2C53)). 

However, results can be mixed. Many studies indicate **non-elite athletes benefit more strongly** than well-trained elites ([
            Nutrition and Supplement Update for the Endurance Athlete: Review and Recommendations - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6628334/#:~:text=can%20improve%20muscle%20economy%2C%20efficiency,12%20%2C%2072%2C52%20%2C%2074)) ([
            Nutrition and Supplement Update for the Endurance Athlete: Review and Recommendations - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6628334/#:~:text=cardiorespiratory%20performance%20at%20anaerobic%20threshold%2C,days%20of%20a%20high%20nitrate)). Elites often already have high baseline NO and efficiency, possibly diminishing the supplement’s impact. Some studies on highly trained runners or cyclists show minimal or no performance change with nitrates – likely because their engines are already finely tuned and possibly because their diet is already rich in nitrates (e.g., a lot of veggies) ([
            Nutrition and Supplement Update for the Endurance Athlete: Review and Recommendations - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6628334/#:~:text=studies%20are%20on%20subjects%20of,and%20was%20associated%20with%20a)). One review noted nitrate supplementation tends to improve performance “mainly in non-elite athletes” ([
            Nutrition and Supplement Update for the Endurance Athlete: Review and Recommendations - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6628334/#:~:text=can%20improve%20muscle%20economy%2C%20efficiency,elite%20athletes%29%20%5B12%2C51%2C52%2C53)). Nonetheless, even for elites, nitrates can be worthwhile in certain conditions (like when oxygen availability is a limiting factor – e.g., high altitude races, or extremely hot conditions where blood flow is crucial). 

**How to Supplement:** The typical protocol is to ingest a high-nitrate dose about **2–3 hours before exercise** (to allow time for conversion to nitric oxide). For beetroot juice, this is often about **500 mL of beet juice** or a concentrated “shot” (which might be ~70 mL concentrated to provide the same nitrates). This provides on the order of 300–600 mg of nitrate (≈ ~5-10 mmol). Studies have used doses like 6–8 mmol of nitrate (which tends to be standard). Some research suggests multiple days of supplementation can further raise plasma nitrite levels – for instance, drinking beet juice daily for 3 days before an event might yield a slightly bigger effect than a single dose ([
            Nutrition and Supplement Update for the Endurance Athlete: Review and Recommendations - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6628334/#:~:text=nitrate%20intake%20or%20supplementation%20may,target%20healthy%20nitrate%20intake%20levels)). One protocol is ~500 mL beet juice per day for 3 days, including race morning. Another approach is acute: take ~2 shots of concentrated beet ~2 hours pre-race (each shot ~4 mmol nitrate, for total ~8 mmol). 

**Timing Nuances:** There’s been discussion on optimal timing. Traditional advice was ~2.5–3h pre-exercise (since nitrate -> nitrite via oral bacteria takes time, and nitrite -> NO peaks around that time). However, recent data suggest starting a bit closer (90 min before) might be beneficial, to ensure peak NO levels coincide with exercise ([
            Nutrition and Supplement Update for the Endurance Athlete: Review and Recommendations - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6628334/#:~:text=results,suboptimal%20time%20interval%20for%20exercise)). In practice, many athletes drink their beet juice about 90 minutes to 2 hours before the race. Consistency matters too – swishing antibacterial mouthwash can impair nitrate’s effect because it kills oral bacteria needed for conversion (so avoid that around the time). 

**Effects Observed:** Nitrate supplementation can **improve time-trial performance modestly**, for example, shaving ~1-2% off a 5k time in some studies ([
            Nutrition and Supplement Update for the Endurance Athlete: Review and Recommendations - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6628334/#:~:text=respiration%20and%20biogenesis%2C%20glucose%20uptake%2C,32%2C51%20%2C%2073%2C53)). It tends to improve endurance in events lasting 10–40 minutes quite reliably in moderately trained subjects. For longer events like a marathon, the evidence is less direct (fewer studies on actual marathon runs), but logically if you improve economy and threshold a bit, it should help. A concern for very long events is that nitrate’s acute effects might wane after ~6-8 hours, but a marathon is within that range. Multi-day “loading” ensures muscle nitrate stores are up, which might sustain effect through the event ([
            Nutrition and Supplement Update for the Endurance Athlete: Review and Recommendations - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6628334/#:~:text=nitrate%20intake%20or%20supplementation%20may,target%20healthy%20nitrate%20intake%20levels)). 

**Other Benefits:** Nitrate (NO) also increases blood flow to muscles and may improve coupling of oxygen utilization – which could help during a marathon by enhancing fuel delivery to muscles. It might also help mitigate some fatigue processes by improving contractile efficiency. Some athletes report feeling “less exhausted” at a given pace after beet juice.

**Elites vs Recreational Differences:** As noted, **elites often see smaller gains**. Some studies on elite cyclists/runners found no significant improvement (possibly because they were near physiological max, or their diet already high nitrate). Recreational runners, who have more room for efficiency improvement, often do see benefits. For example, one study showed that in trained but not elite cyclists, nitrate improved 10k cycling TT performance by a few percent, whereas in elite cyclists it did little ([
            Nutrition and Supplement Update for the Endurance Athlete: Review and Recommendations - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6628334/#:~:text=cardiorespiratory%20performance%20at%20anaerobic%20threshold%2C,days%20of%20a%20high%20nitrate)). This isn’t universal – some elite athletes are “responders.” Given the low risk, many elites still use beetroot shots as part of their pre-race nutrition, figuring any tiny advantage helps. Also, elites might benefit in training – some use nitrates to enhance quality of key workouts.

**Dietary Nitrate vs Supplement:** A neat aspect is you can also get nitrates through diet: eating a **high-nitrate diet (lots of spinach, beets, rocket)** for a week can elevate nitrate levels comparably to supplementation ([
            Nutrition and Supplement Update for the Endurance Athlete: Review and Recommendations - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6628334/#:~:text=nitrate%20intake%20or%20supplementation%20may,target%20healthy%20nitrate%20intake%20levels)). So a marathoner could just ensure their pre-race meals are nitrate-rich. However, the concentration in a shot is easier to measure and consume than eating pounds of vegetables. Many just find it convenient to down a beet juice.

**Potential Drawbacks:** Beetroot juice can cause harmless side effects like *beeturia* (pink/red urine) or red stools, which athletes should be aware of so they don’t panic ([

Also, some people find the taste of beet juice unpleasant or it may cause slight stomach upset (the concentrated shots are strong-tasting). Practicing intake in training can ensure tolerance. Nitrate is generally safe, though extremely high chronic intake might have theoretical risks (like interacting with certain medications or conditions). For healthy athletes, it’s considered safe. 

One interesting caution: mouthwash or chewing gum that kills oral bacteria will blunt the conversion of nitrate to nitrite, so avoid those around the time of consuming nitrates ([

Also, because NO can lower blood pressure, individuals with already low BP should be careful. In fact, **nitrates can slightly reduce resting blood pressure** – some see a 5 mmHg drop ([

        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6628334/#:~:text=during%20high,target%20healthy%20nitrate%20intake%20levels)) – which for an athlete is usually fine, possibly beneficial. But if someone is hypotensive, they should monitor.

**Conclusion on Nitrates:** Nitrate supplementation (e.g. beetroot juice) is an **evidence-backed strategy to enhance endurance performance by improving efficiency and stamina** ([
            Nutrition and Supplement Update for the Endurance Athlete: Review and Recommendations - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6628334/#:~:text=oxide%20has%20numerous%20bodily%20effects,32%2C51%20%2C%2073%2C53)). It’s particularly effective in recreational athletes and in events where oxygen delivery is a limiting factor. For a marathoner, it can mean needing a bit less oxygen at a given pace, which can delay fatigue. Many athletes treat a beet shot as part of their pre-race nutrition just like a carb load – it has become quite mainstream. Given that it might help more for non-elites, recreational runners stand to gain as much if not more than elites from this. As always, practice it out: try a hard long run with and without beet juice and see if you perceive a difference in how hard the effort feels. If it feels easier or your heart rate is slightly lower for the same pace, that’s the nitrate doing its job. 

In summary, **beetroot juice (nitrate) supplementation can make running more efficient and has shown improvements in endurance performance, especially in non-elite runners** ([
            Nutrition and Supplement Update for the Endurance Athlete: Review and Recommendations - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6628334/#:~:text=can%20improve%20muscle%20economy%2C%20efficiency,elite%20athletes%29%20%5B12%2C51%2C52%2C53)). It’s generally used by consuming a high-nitrate dose ~90 minutes before the marathon. Some do a multi-day load leading up. While results vary, the low cost and natural origin (it’s basically concentrated vegetable juice) make it a favorable option. Many marathon runners, from first-timers to Olympians, have “gone purple” with beet juice to gain any edge in the 26.2-mile challenge.

## Ideal Food Examples for Marathon Nutrition  

Translating the science into practice, this section provides **practical food examples** and meal ideas aligning with the nutritional strategies outlined. We will break this down into: **Everyday training diet** (how a marathoner might eat on a regular training day), and **Race-day nutrition** – including specific suggestions for the pre-race meal, during-race fueling, and post-race recovery. These examples cater to both elite-level needs (often just larger quantities) and recreational runners. The principles are the same, but portion sizes and exact choices can be scaled. A focus is on whole-food options that meet macro and micronutrient goals, with mention of convenient sports products where appropriate.

### Everyday Training Diet Examples  
On a typical training day (especially when heavy mileage or key workouts are scheduled), marathoners should consume a **high-carbohydrate, moderate-protein, moderate-fat** diet rich in unprocessed, nutrient-dense foods. Here’s how a day’s meals might look:

- **Breakfast:** A bowl of oatmeal topped with sliced banana and a drizzle of honey, plus a side of Greek yogurt. *(Rationale: Oatmeal and banana provide quality carbs for energy and potassium; honey adds quick carbs. Greek yogurt contributes ~15–20 g protein for muscle repair and calcium for bones.)* For an elite or high-volume trainer, the portion might be large (e.g. 1.5 cups dry oats, 2 bananas, big scoop of yogurt), whereas a recreational runner might have ~1 cup oats, 1 banana, smaller yogurt. This meal yields ~80–120 g carbs (depending on portion) and ~20 g protein – a great start to fuel a morning run.

- **Mid-Morning Snack:** A fruit smoothie made with berries, spinach, a scoop of whey or plant protein, and almond milk. Add a handful of oats or a spoon of peanut butter if extra calories needed. *(Rationale: Smoothies are easy to digest between workouts. Berries and spinach provide vitamins (C, antioxidants, iron from spinach), the protein powder adds ~20 g protein, and a bit of healthy fat from peanut butter can curb hunger. Oats blended in boost carbs.)* For example, a smoothie with 1 cup berries, 1 banana, a cup of spinach, 1 scoop protein, and 8 oz almond milk has ~50 g carbs, 25 g protein, ample micronutrients. This is especially good if an athlete did an AM run and needs to refuel before lunchtime.

- **Lunch:** Grilled chicken (or tofu for vegetarians) sandwich on whole-grain bread with avocado and plenty of veggies (tomato, lettuce); a side of baked sweet potato or pretzels; and perhaps an orange. *(Rationale: Whole-grain bread and sweet potato provide complex carbs and fiber, replenishing glycogen and providing steady energy. The chicken/tofu offers ~25–30 g protein for recovery. Avocado gives healthy fat (and magnesium, potassium), and veggies/fruits add antioxidants and vitamins.)* A specific example: a large sandwich might have ~60 g carbs (bread + condiments + veggies), ~30 g protein (if double chicken breast or thick tofu), ~15 g fat (avocado). Sweet potato adds ~30 g more carbs. This balanced meal supports afternoon training sessions by topping up liver glycogen and nutrients.

- **Afternoon Snack:** Trail mix (nuts and dried fruit) or a couple of energy bars, depending on hunger and schedule. *(Rationale: Nuts (almonds, cashews) provide magnesium, healthy fats, and some protein; dried fruits (raisins, apricots) are rich in iron and quick carbs ([Maximize performance with magnesium! - USA Triathlon](https://www.usatriathlon.org/articles/recovery/maximize-performance-with-magnesium#:~:text=Maximize%20performance%20with%20magnesium%21%20,negative%20consequences%20of%20strenuous%20exercise)). This snack keeps energy levels up and prevents excessive muscle breakdown between meals.)* For example, 1/4 cup of trail mix might have ~15 g carbs, 5 g protein, 10 g fat. If a runner is about to do a second run or gym session, they might opt for an energy bar with ~30 g carbs and ~10 g protein for more immediate fuel.

- **Dinner:** Spaghetti with meat sauce, a side salad, and whole-grain bread. *(Rationale: A classic high-carb meal – pasta is excellent for glycogen (and easy to eat a lot of), lean ground meat or a plant-based alternative adds protein (~20–30 g in a serving) and iron/B12 if red meat is used, and the tomato sauce provides lycopene and extra carbs. A green salad drizzled with olive oil adds fiber, vitamin C (if tomatoes/peppers included) to aid iron absorption, and the bread can mop up extra sauce for more carbs.)* End-of-day carbs help ensure muscle glycogen is filled overnight ([
            Nutrition and Supplement Update for the Endurance Athlete: Review and Recommendations - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6628334/#:~:text=Prior%20to%20the%20race%20,However%20recent)). For an elite, the portion might be two large plates of pasta (~150+ g carbs), whereas a recreational might have a more moderate plate (~75 g carbs). In both cases, this meal is high in carbs to recover from the day and prepare for tomorrow. Olive oil in salad gives healthy fat, and perhaps a glass of milk or fortified almond milk on the side gives calcium and additional protein.

- **Evening Snack (if needed):** Greek yogurt with granola, or cottage cheese with pineapple, or even a small bowl of cereal with milk. *(Rationale: A pre-bed protein (casein from dairy) can support overnight muscle repair; adding some carbs (granola or fruit) keeps glycogen synthesis humming. If weight management is a goal, the athlete might skip a heavy snack; if they’re in heavy training, a 300-400 kcal snack is very justified.)* For instance, 1 cup of Greek yogurt with 1/4 cup granola and some berries might have ~25 g protein, 30 g carbs, beneficial probiotics and fiber.

This sample day hits high carbohydrate (>60% of calories in this example, as marathoners often need ([Runner's Diet | Johns Hopkins Medicine](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/wellness-and-prevention/runners-diet#:~:text=People%20who%20include%20running%20or,of%20their%20calories%20from%20carbohydrates))), adequate protein (~1.5 g/kg or more), and moderate fat (~25–30% calories), plus is rich in micronutrients (fruits, veggies, whole grains, lean meats). It also includes *functional foods* relevant to runners: oats, bananas, and raisins (for carbs and potassium), leafy greens (iron, magnesium), nuts (magnesium, vitamin E), and dairy (calcium, protein). According to Johns Hopkins Medicine, runners should aim for about **60% to 70% of their calories from carbohydrates** ([Runner's Diet | Johns Hopkins Medicine](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/wellness-and-prevention/runners-diet#:~:text=People%20who%20include%20running%20or,of%20their%20calories%20from%20carbohydrates)) – the above plan aligns with that, featuring carbs at every meal and snack. The diet also naturally provides key micros: e.g. iron from meat and spinach, calcium from dairy and greens, sodium from breads and any added salt, etc. 

**Elite vs Recreational Quantities:** The difference is mostly in quantity and perhaps number of snacks. Elites burning 3,000-4,000 kcal/day will simply eat larger portions or additional snacks. For example, an elite might double the breakfast oatmeal serving and add more bread at dinner, or have two sandwiches at lunch instead of one. A recreational runner training less might not need the afternoon snack or might have smaller portions of pasta. But qualitatively, the food choices remain appropriate for both – there’s nothing exotic needed for elites besides more food. In fact, research supports a “food first” approach – many whole foods can substitute sports products effectively for fueling and recovery ([

        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10054587/#:~:text=performance,to%20difficulties%20in%20the%20quantities)). For instance, raisins, bananas, and honey are cited as good carbohydrate sources during exercise, comparable to commercial gels/chews ([

        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10054587/#:~:text=performance,to%20difficulties%20in%20the%20quantities)) ([

So a recreational runner on a budget can use real foods to fuel: a banana and a small box of raisins during a long run in place of a gel provides a mix of sugars (fructose and glucose) much like a sports chew ([
            Carbohydrates and Endurance Exercise: A Narrative Review of a Food First Approach - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10054587/#:~:text=performance,to%20difficulties%20in%20the%20quantities)) ([
            Carbohydrates and Endurance Exercise: A Narrative Review of a Food First Approach - PMC

Overall, the everyday diet for a marathoner should be **plentiful, balanced, and rich in high-quality carbs**. Foods like pasta, rice, potatoes, whole grains, fruits, and starchy vegetables will form the bulk of meals. Lean proteins (chicken, fish, eggs, legumes) appear in moderate amounts regularly to hit protein targets. Healthy fats (avocado, nuts, olive oil, fatty fish) round out the diet for satiety and health. This kind of diet not only fuels training but also helps maintain a strong immune system in the face of heavy training stress, by providing ample micronutrients and antioxidants. Consistency is key – marathoners can’t “cram” nutrition at the last minute; they need to fuel their bodies day in and day out.

### Pre-Race Meal (Marathon Day Morning)  
The pre-race meal is the final top-off for energy stores and should be designed to be **rich in carbohydrates, moderate in protein, low in fat and fiber**, and above all, familiar to the runner ([
            International Society of Sports Nutrition Position Stand: nutritional considerations for single-stage ultra-marathon training and racing - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6839090/#:~:text=the%20event%20,gut%20discomfort%20during%20the%20race)). It’s typically eaten about 2–4 hours before the start, depending on individual tolerance and the race start time. Here are some tried-and-true examples of pre-marathon breakfasts:

- **Option 1: Bagel with Peanut Butter and Banana** – A classic among runners. A plain bagel provides ~50 g of easily digestible carbs. Spread a thin layer of peanut butter for a bit of flavor and protein (~8 g protein, 16 g fat if 2 tbsp – but many will go lighter on the PB to keep fat low), and add sliced banana on top for another ~30 g carbs and potassium. This meal sits well for many because bagels are low-fiber (especially if you choose refined grain bagels) and peanut butter, while fatty, is used sparingly just for some taste and to prevent hunger without overloading fat. Total carbs can be ~80 g, protein ~10 g, fat ~10-15 g. It hits that 1–4 g/kg carb recommendation for most athletes (e.g., ~80 g for a 60-70 kg runner is ~1.2 g/kg if 2 hours out – could add sports drink to push it higher if needed) ([
            Nutrition and Supplement Update for the Endurance Athlete: Review and Recommendations - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6628334/#:~:text=gastrointestinal%20,the%20overnight%20fast%20which%20depletes)). The banana’s low-GI carbs and the sodium in the bagel (bagels are fairly high in salt) also help with fluid retention. Many elites go with a similar plan: e.g. a white bagel or toast with a little almond butter and honey plus a banana – this is basically the same nutrient profile.

- **Option 2: Oatmeal with Fruit** – A bowl of oatmeal (made with water or a bit of low-fat milk) topped with say a sliced apple or berries and a spoon of honey. Add a dash of salt and maybe a few nuts if desired. Oats are moderate in fiber, but by using quick oats and not too huge a portion, many find it digestible. For those with sensitive stomachs, using instant oatmeal (more processed) can actually reduce fiber and speed digestion. For example: 1.5 cups cooked oatmeal (~45 g carbs), a tablespoon of honey (~17 g), a diced peach (~15 g) gives ~75 g carbs, minimal fat, ~5-8 g protein. One could also include a hard-boiled egg or a small yogurt on the side if they want ~5–10 g extra protein – but be cautious with too much protein/fat. An elite might have a larger portion or add a sports drink to sip alongside for extra carbs. The fruit provides some fructose which, combined with the maltose from oatmeal, can maximize carbohydrate uptake (multiple transportable carbs). This meal is still mostly low-GI, which is fine because it’s a couple hours out, preventing blood sugar spikes and crashes. According to an ISSN recommendation, a pre-race meal should be **easily digestible and low in fat/fiber** – oatmeal and fruit fits that ([
            International Society of Sports Nutrition Position Stand: nutritional considerations for single-stage ultra-marathon training and racing - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6839090/#:~:text=the%20event%20,gut%20discomfort%20during%20the%20race)), as long as fiber isn’t excessive.

- **Option 3: Pancakes or White Rice with a Bit of Protein** – Some East African elites famously eat plain **white rice** or stiff porridge before races. Rice is very low fiber and gentle; one could have a bowl of white rice with a little soy sauce (for salt) and maybe a boiled egg or small piece of chicken (for those accustomed to a savory breakfast). This might resemble more of a lunch, but it works if that’s the habitual diet. For Western runners, **pancakes** or waffles (made from refined flour) with a little syrup is an appealing carb-rich meal. Two medium pancakes with syrup can easily provide ~70–90 g carbs, and if a bit of egg or egg whites are in the batter, that’s ~8–10 g protein. Just go easy on butter (fat). Some runners like to top pancakes with a smear of jam or honey instead of lots of butter. This is essentially a high-carb, low-fiber meal too. A bit of scrambled egg whites on the side (no cheese, minimal butter in cooking) can add protein without much fat. The key is these foods are bland and low residue. 

- **Option 4: Smoothie (if solid food is hard to stomach)** – For runners too nervous to chew much, a liquid meal might be preferable. A smoothie made with a couple of bananas, a scoop of carbohydrate powder or maltodextrin, a bit of yogurt, and some water can deliver 60–100 g of carbs in an easily sippable form. One could also use liquid meal supplements (like Ensure, Boost, or special sports formulas) that are high in carbs. For instance, a runner could drink 1–2 bottles of a carb-rich meal replacement providing ~50 g carbs each, plus a bit of protein, about 2 hours before the race. This ensures fueling even if appetite is low. The downside is lack of “bulk” might lead to hunger sooner; but one can then sip a sports drink in the final hour to top up.

No matter the menu, a crucial guideline is to **avoid high fat and high fiber content** in this pre-race meal ([
            International Society of Sports Nutrition Position Stand: nutritional considerations for single-stage ultra-marathon training and racing - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6839090/#:~:text=the%20event%20,gut%20discomfort%20during%20the%20race)). That means skip things like greasy bacon, sausage, excessive butter, heavy cheese, and fibrous bran cereals or large salads. Such foods digest slowly and can cause GI distress mid-race. Also avoid very spicy foods. Usually, runners stick to refined grains (white bread, bagels, low-fiber cereal, rice, etc.), some easily digestible protein (small amounts of egg, dairy, or lean meat), and possibly a little fat but not much. If coffee is part of the routine, most will have their normal cup (since caffeine helps, as discussed, and also ensures a bathroom visit pre-run for many). Just don’t experiment with a double espresso if you’re not used to it.

**Timing & Quantity:** The target is often given as **1 g of carb per kg, per hour out**. For example, if eating 3 hours before, aim ~3 g/kg carbs ([
            Nutrition and Supplement Update for the Endurance Athlete: Review and Recommendations - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6628334/#:~:text=gastrointestinal%20,the%20overnight%20fast%20which%20depletes)). For a 70 kg runner, that’s ~210 g – which is quite a lot, and not everyone can do that much. Many do half that and then sip a sports drink closer to the start. The meal examples above (~70–100 g carbs) cover a 1.5–2h-out scenario for a ~60–70 kg person. If one has 3–4 hours, they might double those carbs or include an extra snack 1 hour out (like an energy gel or sports drink ~15 min pre-start for an extra 25 g). Elites often wake up 3-4 hours early to eat a big breakfast, then maybe take a gel 15 minutes before the gun. Recreational folks often have 2 hours or less due to logistics, so they might eat a bit less and rely on a gel at the start or sports drink to meet the difference. 

**Hydration with the Meal:** It's wise to drink ~500 mL (17 oz) of fluid with the pre-race meal, preferably including electrolytes ([Contemporary Nutrition Strategies to Optimize Performance in Distance Runners and Race Walkers - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30747558/#:~:text=amounts%20sufficient%20for%20event%20fuel,thermal%20challenge%20and%20fluid%20deficit)). For example, having a sports drink or adding a little salt to oatmeal ensures sodium intake which helps the body retain the fluid. Some athletes will drink ~(5–7 ml/kg) of fluid about 2–3 hours pre-race, which for a 70 kg runner is ~350–500 mL, to start well-hydrated ([Contemporary Nutrition Strategies to Optimize Performance in Distance Runners and Race Walkers - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30747558/#:~:text=amounts%20sufficient%20for%20event%20fuel,thermal%20challenge%20and%20fluid%20deficit)). Then they may stop drinking heavily to avoid pit stops, just sipping maybe 100–200 mL in the final hour if needed. Over-hydrating can cause frequent urination and flush electrolytes, so it’s a balance.

In short, an ideal pre-marathon breakfast might be something like: **2 slices of toast with jelly and a small protein (egg or yogurt) + a banana + 1–2 cups of sports drink**, consumed ~2 hours before the race. This is high-carb (~80–100 g), low fiber, low fat, and provides some fluid and sodium – matching sports science recommendations ([
            International Society of Sports Nutrition Position Stand: nutritional considerations for single-stage ultra-marathon training and racing - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6839090/#:~:text=the%20event%20,gut%20discomfort%20during%20the%20race)). It’s also typical of what many marathoners report eating. The most important factor is **familiarity**: the runner should have practiced this meal before long runs to ensure it agrees with them.

### During-Race Fueling  
During the marathon, the focus is on **rapidly digestible carbohydrates and fluids/electrolytes**. Solid foods are generally minimized in a marathon (unlike ultras) because they can be harder to chew and digest at racing intensity. Instead, runners rely on energy gels, chews, sports drinks, and sometimes small easily digestible snacks (like part of a banana). Here are examples of during-race fuel:

- **Energy Gels:** These are concentrated sources of glucose/fructose (~20–30 g carbs per gel pack) with minimal other content (some have a little sodium, some have caffeine). A common strategy is 1 gel every 30–45 minutes, washed down with water. For instance, a runner might take a gel at mile 5, 10, 15, and 20 – totaling ~4 gels (~100+ g carbs) over the race. Gels are essentially the go-to for most marathoners because they are convenient and formulated not to upset the stomach (in most cases). They come in various flavors and with options for added caffeine or electrolytes. **Example:** GU Energy Gel (popular brand) provides ~22 g carbs (mix of maltodextrin and fructose) and ~50–60 mg sodium per packet, and some versions have 20–40 mg caffeine. Taking one at 45-minute intervals yields ~30 g carbs/hour – on the lower end of recommended intake, but many recreational runners do this and supplement with sports drink to reach ~45–60 g/hour total. Elites might take gels more frequently (every 5k which for them is ~15 minutes, but often alternating with drink so effectively every 30 min or so each type). They might even double up late in the race if chasing a record, trying to push towards that 80–90 g/hour intake. 

- **Sports Drinks:** Drinking a carbohydrate-electrolyte solution serves double duty: hydration and fueling. Marathon aid stations typically offer sports drink (e.g. Gatorade Endurance, which has ~18 g carbs and ~300 mg sodium per 8 oz cup). A runner could rely on the sports drink for some or all of their carb intake. For example, drinking ~16 oz per hour of Gatorade Endurance would give ~36 g carbs and ~600 mg sodium per hour. If they also take a gel with ~20–25 g, that totals ~55–60 g/hour – a solid fueling rate ([Contemporary Nutrition Strategies to Optimize Performance in Distance Runners and Race Walkers - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30747558/#:~:text=CHO,cooling%20strategies%20may%20provide%20a)). Some athletes prefer liquid nutrition as it may digest even faster; others like a combo to avoid flavor fatigue. **Example Plan:** Drink 1 cup (~4 oz) of sports drink at every aid station (if stations are ~2 miles apart, a 4-hour marathoner would encounter one roughly every 20–22 minutes). Over an hour that might total ~3 cups (12 oz, ~18 g carbs) – to reach 30–60 g/hour, gels or chews would complement this. Alternatively, drink a larger volume at alternating stations (e.g. 8 oz every 30 min = ~16 oz/hour, ~34 g carbs). The key is to achieve the target carb intake while also meeting fluid needs for thirst. The combination of drink + gel can be adjusted: e.g. if you drink more, you may do fewer gels, and vice versa.

- **Chews or Blocks:** These are basically gummy candies with carbs and sometimes electrolytes/caffeine (e.g. Clif Shot Bloks, Honey Stinger Chews). They often come in 30–60 g packets of multiple chews. A typical chew might have ~4–5 g carbs; a pack of 10 chews ~40–50 g carbs. A runner might nibble on chews continuously – say 2 chews every mile or two. Some prefer these to gels because they can spread the intake gradually (and some find the texture more tolerable than the gel consistency). The caveat is needing to chew can be an issue at high breathing rates, but at recreational paces it’s usually fine. **Example:** A runner carries a pack of chews (about 6 chews = ~24 g carbs per pack). They eat one chew every 10 minutes – that’s ~6 g carbs/10 min, or ~36 g/hour. Combined with sports drink sips for another ~20–30 g/hour, that meets ~50–60 g/hour. The combination of glucose and fructose in many chews allows better uptake (e.g. Shot Bloks use brown rice syrup (glucose) and cane sugar (sucrose) mix). Chews also often include electrolytes: e.g. 3 Clif Bloks provide ~50 mg sodium, and some versions have 25–50 mg caffeine per serving. 

- **Real Food Options:** Though less common in marathons, some runners do fine with small pieces of real food: e.g., half a banana at an aid station (bananas are often provided in big races), which gives ~15 g carbs and potassium. Orange slices are another race offering – they provide quick fructose and water content, though fiber in the pulp could be an issue for sensitive stomachs. Some might carry a few gummy bears or pretzels for variety; a few gummy candies can mimic chews (they are basically the same minus maybe some electrolytes). Pretzels provide salt and some carbs, but too many can be dry/hard to swallow – usually more used in ultras. Honey packets or maple syrup in a flask is an all-natural alternative to gels (honey is ~17 g carbs per tablespoon, largely sugars that absorb fast; in fact some gels are honey-based). 

If using real foods, the key is they must be **easily digestible and not bulky** ([
            International Society of Sports Nutrition Position Stand: nutritional considerations for single-stage ultra-marathon training and racing - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6839090/#:~:text=the%20event%20,gut%20discomfort%20during%20the%20race)). A marathon is not the time for trail mix or energy bars that are high in fiber/fat/protein – those can cause GI distress. That’s why specialized products dominate; they strip away fiber/fat. However, studies have shown whole-food carbs (like raisins) can perform as well as sports jellybeans for running performance ([

        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10054587/#:~:text=of%20these%20CHO,trial%20CHO%20food%20sources%20before)). Thus, a recreational runner could eat a small box of raisins (~30 g carbs) over an hour instead of a gel if they find it palatable. Still, one must consider hydration; gels typically are taken with water to dilute in stomach. Real foods need to be chased with water too.

- **Electrolyte Supplements During:** As discussed in the supplement section, **salt caps or electrolyte drinks** during the race help maintain sodium. Many gels contain ~50–100 mg sodium per serving, which helps but might not fully cover needs. Sports drinks at the course usually have sodium (e.g. ~200+ mg per cup). Some runners in hot marathons take a salt capsule (about 200–300 mg sodium) at half distance if they feel very sweaty or cramp-prone. Example: a runner might swallow one SaltStick capsule (≈215 mg sodium) at mile 13 with water, providing a sodium boost along with the sports drink they sip. This is more common among recreational runners since elites often rely on their fluids prepared. Cramp-prone runners also use things like HotShot or pickle juice, but those are more “emergency” measures; generally, steady electrolyte intake from drinks/gels prevents reaching that point.

**How to carry/execute:** Elites have bottles on tables; they tape gels to bottles or have them pre-mixed in the fluid. Recreational runners often wear a running belt that holds 2–4 gels, or pin gels to their shorts. Some marathons hand out gels at certain mile markers (e.g. at 30K). It’s wise not to rely solely on on-course provisions unless you know the brand/flavor and have trained with them. Many bring their preferred gels. For hydration, recreational runners mostly use aid stations (taking cups). If one desires a specific drink (like a certain brand or a higher carb mix than provided), they might carry a small flask. 

**Fueling Plan Example (4-hour marathoner):**  
- **0:00 (Start):** Already had breakfast 2 hours prior. 5 minutes before start, take 1 caffeinated gel (~25 g carbs, 50 mg caffeine) with a few sips of water – topping off energy and caffeine stores ([
            Nutrition and Supplement Update for the Endurance Athlete: Review and Recommendations - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6628334/#:~:text=,a%20greater%20ergogenic%20effect%20than)).  
- **0:45 (45 min in):** Take 1 gel (~25 g carbs, with some electrolytes) at the aid station, chase with a cup of water.  
- **1:30:** Drink ~8 oz sports drink (~15 g carb) at aid. Eat a few chews (say 2 chews = ~10 g) as leaving station. (~25 g total this interval).  
- **2:00:** Take another gel (~25 g). Also grab half a banana offered at mile 13 (~15 g). This might be ~40 g plus fluids. (If banana might be heavy, skip or only take a few bites. Alternatively, do chews + sports drink if banana not wanted.) Possibly take a salt capsule if very hot (with water).  
- **2:30:** Drink sports drink (~15 g) and take 1 chew (~5 g) – lighter fueling this half-hour because previous was heavy.  
- **3:00:** Take final gel (~25 g, maybe with caffeine for late boost). Wash with water. Also maybe sip some sports drink (~10 g) if thirsty.  
- **3:30:** If feeling okay, maybe just water or sports drink (~10–15 g) at last station. If energy fading, could take an emergency gel or some candy offered by spectators (quick sugar). Many runners can’t tolerate another gel by this point, so even a few sips of flat cola or a hard candy can help for mental boost.  
- **Finish (~4:00):** Total consumption: ~4 gels (~100 g), ~1 pack chews (~20 g), ~various sports drink (~60+ g), banana (~15 g) = roughly 195 g carbs over 4h, which is ~49 g/hour on average. That’s within the recommended 30–60 g/h for recreational. Possibly slightly under target in some hours – could add one more chew or more sports drink to reach ~55 g/hour. Electrolytes: sports drink and gels likely provided ~800–1000 mg sodium in total, plus a capsule (if taken) ~250 mg, so around ~1.0–1.3 g sodium over 4h, which aligns with replacing a portion of sweat losses for a moderate sweater ([
            Nutrition and Supplement Update for the Endurance Athlete: Review and Recommendations - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6628334/#:~:text=environmental%20conditions,and%20the%20average%20sodium)). The runner also listened to thirst and drank to stay hydrated but not overly full.

This plan would vary for an elite (they might do ~60–80 g/hour via more frequent intake, and finish in 2+ hours so total ~150–180 g over race). But the principle stands: start fueling early, regularly intake a combo of drink and gels to hit ~50+ g carbs per hour, include sodium, and use caffeine strategically (most often before or maybe a mid-race small dose). Adjust this template to individual tolerance – some runners prefer more frequent smaller intakes (e.g. a sip of gel every mile) rather than a whole packet at once, etc.

### Post-Race Recovery Nutrition  
After completing the marathon, the body is in a depleted, fatigued state: glycogen stores are low, muscles have micro-damage, and the runner is likely dehydrated. Proper post-race nutrition aids in **replenishing, repairing, rehydrating, and revitalizing**. It’s often summarized as the Four R’s of recovery: **Rehydrate, Refuel, Repair, and Rest**. Nutrition addresses the first three R’s directly (rest is time/sleep). Key components of recovery nutrition are **carbohydrates** to refuel glycogen, **protein** to repair muscles, and **fluids with electrolytes** to rehydrate ([

        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6628334/#:~:text=match%20at%20L726%20commercial%20sports,discussed%20in%20Recovery%20Nutrition%20section)) ([
            Carbohydrates and Endurance Exercise: A Narrative Review of a Food First Approach - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10054587/#:~:text=exercise%20event%20to%20ensure%20that,of%20the%20previous%20exercise%20bout)).

**Immediately (0–30 minutes post-finish):** The runner may not feel like eating solid food right away – intense exercise can suppress appetite transiently – but this window is great for recovery nutrition. **Liquids or light snacks** are often most palatable right after finishing. Examples: 

- **Chocolate Milk:** Touted as an ideal recovery drink, chocolate milk naturally has ~3:1 to 4:1 ratio of carbs:protein (about 30 g carbs, 8 g protein per 8 oz) and contains fluids and electrolytes like calcium and sodium. Research has shown chocolate milk is as effective as commercial recovery beverages for promoting glycogen resynthesis and muscle repair ([From BS&W: Nutrition - Fuel for your Training | The Cowtown Marathon](https://www.cowtownmarathon.org/post/nutrition-fuel-for-your-training#:~:text=From%20BS%26W%3A%20Nutrition%20,is%20low%20in%20fat)). Many marathon finish lines now offer chocolate milk. An elite might chug 16 oz (getting ~60 g carb, 16 g protein) which begins recovery quickly. Recreational runners also find it convenient and palatable. (If lactose-intolerant, choose lactose-free milk or a soy milk with similar macros; some companies also make plant-based chocolate recovery drinks fortified with protein.)

- **Recovery Shake or Sports Drink + Protein:** Some prefer a specialized recovery shake powder mixed with water (often containing ~20 g whey protein plus ~40–80 g carbs from maltodextrin or sugars). For instance, a runner could have a bottle of Gatorade (which provides ~34 g carb in 20 oz) and eat a protein bar (with ~20 g protein, 25 g carbs) in the finish area. Together that gives ~60 g carbs, 20 g protein. Or they might mix a packet of recovery drink (like Endurox R4 or Skratch Labs Recovery) in water – these products typically hit the 4:1 carb:protein ratio (e.g. 50 g carb, 12 g protein). The exact brand is less important than getting those macros in. **Key target:** about **1.0–1.2 g/kg of carbs and ~0.25–0.4 g/kg of protein within the first hour** ([
            Carbohydrates and Endurance Exercise: A Narrative Review of a Food First Approach - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10054587/#:~:text=exercise%20event%20to%20ensure%20that,of%20the%20previous%20exercise%20bout)) (for a 70 kg runner, ~70-85 g carbs, ~18-28 g protein). This immediate feeding helps maximize glycogen restoration and muscle protein synthesis while the muscles are highly receptive (the so-called anabolic window). 

- **Banana + Whey Protein:** If no fancy products are around, simple choices work. A banana provides ~30 g fast-acting carbs and some potassium; a scoop of whey protein in water gives ~20–25 g protein and some BCAAs for muscle repair. This combo is easy to carry and consume. Add a pinch of salt or some pretzels for sodium if needed. Some runners pack a recovery kit with these items in their checked bag.

- **Electrolyte Drink:** Rehydrating is crucial. Ideally, weigh yourself before and after the race if possible to know how much fluid was lost. If down 2 kg, aim to drink ~3 L over the next hours along with food to fully rehydrate. Often runners crave something not too sweet after all the gels – so an electrolyte beverage like Pedialyte, a sports drink with extra sodium, or even a light broth can quench thirst and provide sodium. Water alone is okay, but adding electrolytes accelerates recovery by retaining water better ([
            Nutrition and Supplement Update for the Endurance Athlete: Review and Recommendations - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6628334/#:~:text=match%20at%20L726%20commercial%20sports,discussed%20in%20Recovery%20Nutrition%20section)). For example, a bottle of Pedialyte has ~1000 mg sodium per liter, which is great for rehydration; even a bag of salty pretzels plus water can work. 

**Within 2 Hours Post-Race:** Once the runner’s stomach settles and appetite returns (usually within an hour or two), a more substantial **meal** should be consumed. This meal should be high in carbs, contain a good amount of protein, and some healthy fats and micronutrients to aid overall recovery and immune function. Some examples:

- **Burrito or Wrap:** A whole-grain tortilla wrap with grilled chicken (or beans), rice, black beans, cheese, lettuce, salsa, and guacamole. This provides a mix of carbs from the tortilla and rice (e.g. ~80–100 g carbs if a large burrito with rice and beans), protein from chicken/beans/cheese (~30 g+), and sodium from the salsa/seasoning (which helps replace salt lost) ([
            Nutrition and Supplement Update for the Endurance Athlete: Review and Recommendations - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6628334/#:~:text=environmental%20conditions,and%20the%20average%20sodium)). The avocado gives healthy fat and magnesium. It’s a hearty meal that will replenish glycogen and provide amino acids for muscle repair. Many runners find they get ravenous a couple hours post-finish, so something like a burrito is very satisfying. (One caution: if your stomach is still sensitive, keep things like hot salsa or super spicy foods moderate initially.)

- **Pizza with Lean Protein:** Pizza offers lots of carbs in the crust and is usually high in salt, which can actually be beneficial post-marathon to help restore electrolyte balance. Adding a lean protein topping like chicken or having a side of cottage cheese can bump the protein. Example: 3 slices of veggie-and-chicken pizza might give ~90 g carbs, ~30 g protein, and lots of sodium. Pizza also has fat, which is fine in recovery (no need to avoid fat after exercise, since immediate digestion speed is less critical than during exercise). Plus, if that’s what the runner craves, it’s better to eat something palatable than force something “perfect.” Many recreational runners celebrate with pizza and beer – not the textbook ideal, but the pizza actually hits many recovery needs (carbs, protein, salt). The beer (alcohol) in moderation (one drink) probably won’t derail recovery and provides some carbs and fluid; but more alcohol could impede muscle recovery and rehydration, so moderation is key. A non-alcoholic beer is a fine alternative which provides maltose (carbs) and polyphenols without the ethanol.

- **Protein-Rich Grain Bowl:** A bowl with quinoa or rice, roasted vegetables, and a protein like salmon or tofu, plus a yogurt-based sauce or olive oil. For example, a bowl containing 1 cup quinoa (~40 g carbs), a piece of salmon (~25 g protein, plus omega-3 fats which may help reduce inflammation), roasted sweet potatoes and broccoli (~20 g carbs, lots of vitamin A/C), and a dollop of Greek yogurt or tahini sauce. This is a nutrient-dense recovery meal supplying quality protein, high-GI and low-GI carbs, and antioxidants from veggies to aid muscle recovery. It aligns with recommendations to include protein with carbs to stimulate muscle protein synthesis and glycogen refilling ([
            Carbohydrates and Endurance Exercise: A Narrative Review of a Food First Approach - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10054587/#:~:text=exercise%20event%20to%20ensure%20that,of%20the%20previous%20exercise%20bout)).

- **Pasta with Meat and Veggies:** Another classic – perhaps penne pasta with a tomato-meat sauce and a side of spinach salad. Pasta will reload glycogen (add breadsticks if more carbs needed), the meat or plant protein in sauce provides protein and iron/zinc, tomato sauce offers potassium and antioxidants, and a salad with mixed greens, tomatoes, and bell peppers gives vitamin C and other micronutrients. A bit of olive oil on the salad adds healthy fat. This type of meal ensures the runner’s energy stores are being refilled and tissue repair is supported. It’s no coincidence that many post-race parties serve things like pasta or chili – they are effective recovery foods.

**Micronutrients in Recovery:** It’s beneficial to include fruits and/or vegetables in the post-race period to supply vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants that can help combat oxidative stress from the marathon. For instance, berries or tart cherry juice can help reduce inflammation and muscle soreness (tart cherry juice is actually studied for reducing post-marathon inflammation and perceived muscle pain due to its anthocyanin content). Some runners do a regimen of tart cherry juice (8–12 oz daily) for a few days around the race to aid recovery. Similarly, pineapple or papaya are thought to help due to bromelain and vitamin C. While not magic, including a fruit smoothie or veggie soup in the recovery phase certainly won’t hurt and likely helps overall recovery and immune support.

**Rehydration specifics:** A simple guideline is to **replace ~150% of the weight lost as fluid** over the next 4–6 hours ([
            Nutrition and Supplement Update for the Endurance Athlete: Review and Recommendations - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6628334/#:~:text=match%20at%20L726%20commercial%20sports,discussed%20in%20Recovery%20Nutrition%20section)). So if down 2 kg (~2 L water), drink about 3 L. Including sodium at ~1 g per liter helps the body retain this fluid ([

        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6628334/#:~:text=environmental%20conditions,and%20the%20average%20sodium)). This could be through an electrolyte solution, brothy soup, salted foods, etc. Listen to thirst as well – the# Optimal Nutrition Strategies for Marathon Running

## Introduction  
Marathon running places extreme demands on the body’s energy systems and recovery processes. Optimal nutrition is crucial to fuel training, enhance performance on race day, and aid recovery. Both elite and recreational marathoners benefit from evidence-based dietary strategies, though elites often fine-tune these to a greater degree (e.g. higher absolute intakes and personalized plans) while recreational runners may need to adapt guidelines to their tolerance and lifestyle. In general, **carbohydrates** are the primary fuel for endurance running, **protein** supports muscle recovery, and **fat** provides essential nutrients and a secondary energy source. Adequate **micronutrients** (vitamins and minerals) are needed to sustain performance and health, and certain **supplements** have proven ergogenic benefits for endurance. Below, we break down optimal marathon nutrition by macronutrients, micronutrients, and evidence-backed supplements, and provide practical food examples for both training and race day. Differences between elites and recreational runners are noted where relevant (e.g. elites may sustain higher carb intake during races, whereas recreational runners must be cautious with gastrointestinal comfort and hydration). A summary of key recommendations is provided at the end.

## Macronutrients in Marathon Training and Racing  

Marathoners must balance carbohydrates, proteins, and fats to meet the high energy expenditure of training and racing. The **ratios** often shift during training versus race prep, but all three macros remain important. Timing and quantity of intake are critical – for example, when to carbo-load, how to space protein intake, and minimizing fat around key workouts or race day. Below we discuss each macronutrient:

### Carbohydrates  
**Role & Daily Needs:** Carbohydrates (CHO) are the dominant fuel for marathon running, supplying glucose for muscle glycogen. High daily carb intake is needed to support the heavy training load and to refill glycogen stores between sessions. Sports nutrition guidelines suggest endurance athletes doing moderate training (~1 hour/day) consume about **5–7 g of carbohydrate per kg body weight per day** (g/kg/day), increasing to **6–10 g/kg/day** for 1–3 hours of training, and up to **8–12 g/kg/day** for extreme high-volume training. Elite marathoners typically fall on the higher end due to their intense, high-mileage regimens, whereas recreational runners with lower training volume may aim for the middle of these ranges. However, even recreational runners should target the upper ranges on heavy training days to ensure optimal recovery and performance. Carbs are a more oxygen-efficient fuel than fat, yielding more energy (ATP) per liter of O₂; when muscle and liver glycogen run low, fatigue (“hitting the wall”) ensues. Thus, ample carbohydrate is the foundation of a marathoner’s diet to delay fatigue. 

**Training Considerations:** To **recover optimally** and “train hard” day to day, marathoners should consume enough carbs to fully replenish glycogen after key workouts. This generally means prioritizing carbohydrate in each meal and snack around training. Many elites distribute carbs strategically (periodization), sometimes training on slightly lower glycogen to stimulate adaptation, but there is **no strong evidence** that chronic low-carb diets improve endurance training outcomes. In fact, prolonged low-CHO availability can impair training intensity and performance. Most research supports a high-carb diet for maximizing training quality. That said, some athletes practice “train low, race high” – occasionally doing base runs with low glycogen (to boost fat oxidation) but always restoring carbs for hard sessions and races. This approach remains experimental; the consensus is that a balanced high-CHO diet is optimal for marathon training for both recreational and elite runners.

**Race Week & Carb-Loading:** In the final days before a marathon, athletes often **carbohydrate-load** to maximize glycogen stores. For races longer than ~90 minutes (which includes the marathon), a classic *glycogen supercompensation* protocol can improve performance by ~2–3%. Modern protocols are more convenient than older methods: simply tapering exercise and consuming ~**10–12 g/kg/day of carbs for 1–2 days** prior to the race is usually sufficient to fully top up muscle glycogen. Research shows you **do not** need a depletion phase of exhaustive exercise followed by a week of high carbs – even a short bout of high-intensity exercise or complete rest, followed by one day of very high carb intake (~10–12 g/kg), can achieve near-maximal glycogen stores. During these carb-loading days, runners often reduce fiber and limit very fatty foods to avoid gastrointestinal (GI) bulk; the emphasis is on easily digestible starches and sugars. For example, an elite 70 kg runner might eat on the order of 700 g of carbs per day during carb-loading (e.g. pasta, rice, bread, sports drinks, fruit, low-fiber cereals). A recreational runner will scale this to their body weight – e.g. a 60 kg runner targeting ~600 g carbs in carb-load – which still requires consciously high carb portions. Notably, elite runners have higher absolute intakes and may tolerate ~12 g/kg, whereas recreational runners should aim for at least ~8–10 g/kg if possible. In both cases, the goal is the same: start the marathon with maximized glycogen stores.

**Pre-Race Meal (Race Morning):** On race day, a final pre-race meal helps top off liver glycogen (which can deplete overnight) and maintain blood sugar. The general guideline is **1–4 g/kg of carbohydrates about 1–4 hours before** the start. Runners should choose a familiar, easily digestible meal that is high in carbs, moderate in protein, and low in fat and fiber to minimize GI distress ([
            International Society of Sports Nutrition Position Stand: nutritional considerations for single-stage ultra-marathon training and racing - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6839090/#:~:text=the%20event%20,gut%20discomfort%20during%20the%20race)). For example, 2–3 hours before the race an athlete might have oatmeal with a banana and honey, or white toast with peanut butter and a sports drink – providing ~100+ grams of low-GI carbs. Elite runners often eat closer to 3–4 hours prior due to early race start times, while recreational runners might have a lighter breakfast if nerves are high, but **should still aim for ~1–2 g/kg** even in a shorter window (e.g. ~70–140 g for a 70 kg runner a couple hours out). Critical is that the foods are *tried in training* – “nothing new on race day.” As an ISSN position stand emphasizes, the pre-race meal should be **familiar, easily-digestible, rich in low-glycemic carbs, and low in fat/fiber** to avoid gut discomfort ([
            International Society of Sports Nutrition Position Stand: nutritional considerations for single-stage ultra-marathon training and racing - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6839090/#:~:text=the%20event%20,gut%20discomfort%20during%20the%20race)).

**During the Marathon (Carbohydrate Fueling):** Consuming carbohydrates during the race is a proven strategy to maintain blood glucose, delay glycogen depletion, and improve performance. The capacity to absorb and use carbs during exercise is limited, so the recommended intake depends on race duration and individual tolerance. For events like the marathon (~2–5 hours), sports nutrition research suggests targeting **~30–60 grams of carbohydrate per hour**, and well-trained athletes may benefit from up to ~90 g/h in longer races if they have trained their gut to handle it. Elite marathoners, who complete the race in ~2–2.5 hours, often ingest ~60–80+ g/h (typically via sports drinks and gels) to sustain their high running intensity. For example, many elites plan ~4–6 energy gels (20–25 g each) over a marathon and supplement with carb-rich drinks to approach the upper intake range. Recreational runners going 4+ hours can also benefit from high carb intake, but they may opt for the lower end (~30–50 g/h) if that is all they can tolerate, since GI issues become more likely at higher intake without acclimatization. Even **small amounts** of carbohydrate can help – for instance, rinsing the mouth with a carbohydrate solution has been shown to improve performance in shorter endurance events, leveraging central nervous system effects. For the marathon, however, a steady intake is preferred. Practically, runners can consume a gel (≈20–30 g) every 30–45 minutes with water, or sip a sports drink providing ~30–60 g per hour. Products combining multiple carb sources (e.g. glucose + fructose) enable higher absorption rates (~90 g/h) and are used by many elites. The key is to **practice** fueling during long training runs to train the digestive system. Well-conditioned elite runners often tolerate aggressive carb feeding with minimal issues, whereas recreational runners should build up intake gradually to avoid stomach upset. Nonetheless, the performance benefit of carb fueling during the marathon is substantial for both groups – it spares muscle glycogen and prevents the precipitous drop in blood sugar that causes the infamous “bonk”.

**Post-Run Recovery (Carbs):** After long training runs and the marathon itself, high-carb foods aid rapid glycogen replenishment. This is most crucial when recovery time is short (e.g. training again the next day). A general recommendation is to ingest **~1.0–1.2 g/kg of carbohydrate in the first hour or two after** intense or long exercise, and continue regular carbohydrate intake in subsequent hours. In practice, combining carbs with some protein immediately post-exercise can enhance glycogen re-synthesis and kick-start muscle repair. For example, a recovery drink of 60–80 g glucose with 15–20 g protein (approximately a 3:1 or 4:1 carb:protein ratio) within 30 minutes post-run is a common strategy. High glycemic index carbs (such as white bread, rice, potatoes, or a sports drink) are effective in this window. While immediate refueling is less urgent for recreational runners who may have days to recover, it is still beneficial for reducing fatigue and muscle soreness. Both elite and recreational runners should follow a long run or race with a substantial meal rich in carbs to fully restore glycogen over the next 24 hours. As one review notes, the **speed of recovery depends on timing and quantity of carbohydrate** – rapid intake of a large enough amount is needed to maximize glycogen restoration. Thus, a post-marathon recovery plan might include an initial snack (e.g. sports drink or chocolate milk and a banana at the finish) followed by a larger meal (e.g. a rice or pasta-based dish) a bit later.

### Protein  
**Role & Daily Needs:** Protein is essential for muscle repair, remodeling, and recovery in endurance athletes. While running is not as muscle-damaging as heavy resistance exercise, marathon training (especially high mileage and downhill running) does cause muscle fiber breakdown, and adequate protein helps optimize training adaptations. Endurance athletes are advised to consume **approximately 1.2–2.0 g of protein per kg body weight per day**. This is a higher intake than the general population RDA, reflecting greater need for tissue repair and for supporting lean mass. In practice, **1.5 g/kg/day** is often cited as a reasonable target (e.g. ~105 g/day for a 70 kg runner), with elite runners possibly at the upper end if they are balancing heavy training and lean mass maintenance. Notably, some recreational runners (especially those with low-calorie diets) may under-consume protein, risking suboptimal recovery. Both elites and recreational athletes should ensure each day’s meals collectively meet these protein needs.

**Timing and Distribution:** How protein is distributed across the day matters for maximizing muscle protein synthesis. Rather than one large serving, it’s ideal to split protein into moderate doses. Consensus guidelines recommend **~0.3 g/kg of high-quality protein every 3–5 hours** throughout the day. For a 70 kg runner, 0.3 g/kg is ~21 g protein per feeding – roughly the amount in 3 eggs or a scoop of whey protein. This pattern ensures a steady supply of amino acids for muscle repair. Marathoners should pay special attention to **post-exercise protein** intake. Consuming ~20–30 g protein soon after a key workout or race (within 30–60 minutes) helps stimulate muscle repair and adaptation. For example, following a long run, one might have Greek yogurt with fruit, a protein shake, or a tuna sandwich to supply protein along with carbs. Interestingly, ingesting a small amount of protein *before* or *during* exercise has been studied (to reduce muscle damage or supply extra fuel), but for marathons this is generally not necessary and can cause GI distress. The focus should be on pre-loading carbs and then taking protein **after** the run for recovery. During ultra-endurance events (beyond marathon length), some protein or BCAAs during the race might help minimize muscle breakdown, but for a marathon there’s no strong evidence that mid-race protein improves performance. What is important is **consistent daily intake**: both elites and recreational runners should include protein-rich foods in each meal (e.g. eggs, dairy, lean meat, fish, legumes, tofu) to meet the 1.2–2.0 g/kg goal. This supports better recovery so the athlete can handle high training volumes. 

**Race-Day Protein:** On the day of competition, protein is not a primary fuel, but a small amount in the pre-race meal can help satiety and provide amino acids to curb muscle breakdown. For instance, having a little protein (10–20 g, such as a small serving of whey or some peanut butter) in the breakfast 2–3h before the marathon is fine, but one should avoid large protein portions that could slow digestion or cause GI upset. During the marathon, most runners consume negligible protein (focus is on carbs and hydration), and that’s fine – the body can rely on stored amino acids for those few hours. After the race, as noted, **protein intake is critical**: aim for ~20 g high-quality protein in the immediate recovery meal to initiate muscle repair, and continue with regular protein-containing meals/snacks as hunger returns. This will aid in rebuilding any muscle damage from the race and can help immune function as well. 

### Fats  
**Role & Daily Needs:** Dietary fats are a vital component of an endurance athlete’s diet, contributing essential fatty acids for health, aiding in the absorption of fat-soluble vitamins, and providing a dense source of energy. While carbs are the marathoner’s main performance fuel, fats serve as the primary fuel at lower intensities and for longer-duration base training. A common recommendation is that athletes get roughly **20–35% of their total calories from fat**, similar to general healthy eating guidelines. Importantly, **fat should not be overly restricted** – intakes below ~20% of calories are *not* advised for athletes, as very low-fat diets can impair absorption of fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, K) and potentially affect hormone levels. In absolute terms, many marathoners will consume ~1–1.5 g/kg of fat per day (which for a 70 kg runner might be 70–105 g of fat daily, though usually we think in percentage of calories). Both elite and recreational runners should include healthy fats (e.g. nuts, seeds, olive oil, avocado, fatty fish) in their daily diet for overall health and inflammation modulation. These foods provide omega-3 fatty acids and monounsaturated fats that support cardiovascular health and may assist recovery. 

**Fat as Fuel and “Training Low”:** Marathon running relies more on carbohydrate at race pace, but fat is a significant fuel source, especially for longer training runs at moderate intensity. Well-trained athletes become very efficient at oxidizing fat – an adaptation that spares glycogen. In fact, elites typically have such well-developed fat metabolism that even when their glycogen is nearly exhausted after hours of exercise, they can continue at a moderate pace by burning fat and lactate. This partially explains how an elite can avoid complete collapse even when “running on fumes.” Some endurance athletes experiment with high-fat, low-carb (HFLC) diets or ketogenic diets to further enhance fat oxidation. While HFLC diets do increase fat-burning capacity, they usually *reduce* the ability to utilize carbohydrate at high intensities. Current evidence does not show performance benefits of a long-term high-fat, low-carb diet for marathons. In fact, chronically low-carb intake can compromise training intensity and lead to slower race times for most runners. As noted earlier, a periodized approach (occasionally training with low glycogen) can be a tool, but the competition strategy is invariably high carbohydrate (“**train low, race high**” concept). Therefore, the general advice is to consume adequate fat for health and satiety, but **prioritize carbs** for fueling intense workouts and races.

**Timing – When to Limit Fat:** One scenario where fat intake is consciously limited is around key high-CHO time points, because fat can slow digestion. For example, in the **1–2 days of carb-loading** before a marathon, runners often reduce fat intake (and fiber) to allow room for more carbs and to avoid GI issues. Similarly, the **pre-race meal** should not be heavy in fat – e.g. avoid greasy foods on race morning, as they delay gastric emptying and could cause discomfort ([
            International Society of Sports Nutrition Position Stand: nutritional considerations for single-stage ultra-marathon training and racing - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6839090/#:~:text=the%20event%20,gut%20discomfort%20during%20the%20race)). But outside of those specific windows, marathoners should eat balanced meals including some fat. There is no need to follow an extremely low-fat diet during the training season; doing so could leave an athlete constantly hungry and even at risk for fat-soluble vitamin deficiencies or inadequate essential fatty acids. **At least ~20% of calories from fat** is recommended, and many athletes do well with ~30% for adequate energy. For instance, a diet of 3,000 kcal for a high-training elite could include ~80 g of fat (which is ~25% of kcal). For a recreational runner eating 2,500 kcal, ~70 g fat (~25%) would be reasonable. Emphasis should be on “quality” fats: nuts, nut butter, olive oil, avocado, oily fish (salmon, sardines) and flax/chia provide beneficial fats and anti-inflammatory omega-3s, which can aid recovery. Saturated fats (butter, fatty meats) can be included in moderation, but ultra-processed high-fat junk foods should be limited as they provide poor nutrient value. In summary, **fat is a necessary part of the marathon diet for health and baseline energy needs**, but intake should be moderated so as not to crowd out carbohydrates. During competition phases, minimize high-fat foods in the meals immediately before running or during the race. 

*Difference between Elite and Recreational Runners:* Generally, macronutrient principles apply similarly to elites and recreational runners, but **elite runners** often operate closer to the upper limits of carb intake (both daily and during races) and have nutritionists fine-tuning their plans. **Recreational runners** might not always meet ideal carb targets due to lifestyle or knowledge gaps – for instance, many amateur runners inadvertently eat too little carbohydrate and experience “bonking” mid-race. Similarly, some recreational runners under-eat protein (especially if trying to lose weight concurrently), which can hinder recovery. Elites, on the other hand, tend to be meticulous about protein intake to prevent injuries and promote adaptation. In terms of fat, recreational runners sometimes go too low (in misguided efforts to lose weight quickly) or too high (following fad diets). Elites usually maintain a balanced intake, using fat mainly for general nutrition rather than fuel. A notable difference is gut training: elites regularly practice consuming 60–90 g/h of carbs in training and thus can aggressively fuel on race day, whereas a recreational runner might only manage 30–50 g/h without GI upset. Each individual is unique, but broadly, the **same guidelines (high carbs, moderate protein, moderate fat)** are the starting point – the differences are in fine-tuning quantities to body size and training load. Importantly, any runner – novice or Olympian – will benefit from **fuelling adequately** rather than trying to “run a marathon on fumes.”

## Micronutrients: Key Vitamins and Minerals for Marathoners  

While macronutrients supply energy and building blocks, **micronutrients** (vitamins and minerals) play vital roles in oxygen transport, bone health, muscle contraction, and energy metabolism. Endurance training can increase the demand for certain micronutrients, and deficiencies can impede performance. Marathon runners should aim to meet or exceed the recommended dietary intakes for all vitamins and minerals through a varied, nutrient-dense diet. Here we highlight a few micronutrients that are particularly important for endurance performance and recovery: **iron**, **magnesium**, and **sodium** (plus other electrolytes). We also briefly note others like calcium, vitamin D, and potassium. These nutrients are critical for both elite and recreational runners, though those without professional guidance (often recreational athletes) should be especially mindful to avoid hidden deficiencies.

### Iron  
**Why It’s Important:** Iron is crucial for endurance athletes because it’s a core component of hemoglobin and myoglobin, the proteins that carry oxygen in blood and muscle. High aerobic performance depends on robust oxygen delivery to muscles; if iron stores are low, the body’s capacity to transport oxygen drops, leading to fatigue. **Iron deficiency**, even without anemia, can impair muscle function and limit endurance capacity, negatively affecting performance and training adaptation. A marathoner low in iron will struggle to sustain training paces and may feel excessive fatigue. Chronic iron deficiency undermines both performance and the adaptations to training (like increasing VO₂max). 

**Risk Factors for Runners:** Marathoners have several risk factors for iron depletion. Iron is lost through sweat, and runners (especially high-mileage elites) also experience “footstrike hemolysis” – the impact can break red blood cells in capillaries, leading to iron loss over time. Female runners are at particular risk due to menstrual iron losses and typically lower dietary iron intake. Vegetarians and vegans must be vigilant, as plant-based iron (non-heme iron) has lower bioavailability than heme iron from animal foods. Heavy training can also elevate hepcidin (an iron-regulating hormone) temporarily, which reduces iron absorption in the hours post-exercise. These factors mean marathoners, especially elites or those with restrictive diets, often have increased iron needs. It’s not uncommon for sports dietitians to monitor serum ferritin (iron stores) in elite runners and intervene if levels drop too low.

**Meeting Iron Needs:** The best approach is to consume iron-rich foods regularly. Heme iron sources such as red meat (beef, venison, lamb), poultry, and fish are well-absorbed. Plant sources like beans, lentils, tofu, spinach, and fortified cereals contribute as well; pairing them with vitamin C (e.g. citrus, berries, bell peppers) can enhance non-heme iron absorption. For example, a stir-fry with beef and broccoli or oatmeal with raisins and strawberries can improve iron uptake. The RDA for iron is ~18 mg/day for premenopausal women and 8 mg/day for men, but athletes may need more. Many female marathoners target ~20+ mg/day through diet and supplements if needed. **Supplementation:** Iron supplements should only be used under guidance when a deficiency is identified. Research shows iron supplements improve performance **only if the athlete is iron-deficient**; taking high-dose iron when already sufficient doesn’t boost performance and may cause GI issues. Excess iron can also interfere with other minerals (like zinc) and cause oxidative stress. Runners should get periodic blood checks for ferritin, especially if fatigued or underperforming. If levels are low, iron supplementation can significantly improve energy and recovery ([
            Exploring the Relationship between Micronutrients and Athletic Performance: A Comprehensive Scientific Systematic Review of the Literature in Sports Medicine - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10302780/#:~:text=Iron%20deficiency%2C%20whether%20combined%20with,Dairy%20products%2C%20sardines%20and%20salmon)). If levels are normal, focus on maintaining an iron-rich diet. Both elite and recreational runners have experienced slumps from unrecognized iron deficiency – so this is a **critical micronutrient** to monitor.

### Magnesium  
**Why It’s Important:** Magnesium (Mg) is involved in **hundreds of enzymatic reactions** in the body, including energy production (ATP synthesis) and muscle and nerve function. For endurance athletes, magnesium plays a key role in muscle contraction and relaxation, and it contributes to bone health. Importantly, magnesium is required for steps in oxidative energy metabolism – if magnesium status is suboptimal, an athlete may fatigue sooner. Marginal magnesium deficiency can impair exercise performance and amplify the negative effects of strenuous exercise. Without enough magnesium, a runner might struggle to hit peak performance or recover optimally. Some studies show a direct correlation between high physical activity and increased magnesium requirements, which makes sense: athletes lose magnesium through sweat and urine, and their muscles demand more Mg during exercise. 

**Signs of Low Magnesium & Prevalence:** Magnesium deficiency can manifest as muscle cramps, tremors, or excessive soreness, but even without obvious symptoms, many people under-consume magnesium. Athletes may not realize they are insufficient. Magnesium helps modulate inflammation; insufficient Mg means the body’s ability to cope with exercise-induced inflammation is reduced. Low Mg can also contribute to poor sleep, which hampers recovery. Full deficiency is uncommon, but mild insufficiency could hinder a marathoner’s recovery and performance. Both elites and recreational runners should ensure they meet the RDA (~400 mg/day for men, 310 mg/day for women). Diets that restrict calories or cut out whole grains and nuts can easily be low in magnesium.

**Food Sources & Strategies:** Magnesium is abundant in many healthy foods. Top sources include nuts and seeds (almonds, cashews, pumpkin seeds), legumes (beans, lentils), whole grains (brown rice, whole wheat, quinoa), and leafy greens (spinach, kale). For example, 1 oz of almonds has ~80 mg Mg, 1 cup cooked spinach ~150 mg, and 1 cup black beans ~120 mg. Including these foods daily can reach the ~300–400 mg target. A marathoner’s diet rich in whole grains and veggies often covers magnesium needs, but high sweat losses or restrictive diets might warrant extra attention. Some athletes take Mg supplements or electrolyte blends with Mg, especially if they cramp frequently. Magnesium supplementation in deficient individuals can improve exercise performance. However, there’s no need to mega-dose if diet is adequate – surplus Mg is excreted, and too much at once can cause diarrhea. The pragmatic approach: ensure a magnesium-rich food at most meals (e.g. oatmeal or almonds at breakfast, beans or greens at lunch/dinner). If you suspect low intake (or have symptoms like unexplained cramps or high blood pressure), consider a modest supplement (~200–300 mg) after consulting a healthcare provider. Also note magnesium works with vitamin D and calcium for bone and muscle health – all need to be sufficient. 

In summary, **magnesium is crucial for marathoners’ energy metabolism and neuromuscular function**. Both elites and recreational runners should consume Mg-rich foods daily. This maintains muscle function and may reduce cramp risk and excessive soreness. If diet is lacking (e.g. someone who avoids nuts and whole grains), correcting that is a priority. Adequate magnesium supports heavy training loads by keeping enzymes and muscles working efficiently.

### Sodium & Electrolytes  
**Why They Matter:** *Electrolytes* – particularly **sodium** – maintain fluid balance, nerve impulses, and muscle contractions. Sodium (with potassium, chloride, etc.) is lost in sweat. Marathon runners can lose a lot of sodium in a long race, especially in heat or if they are salty sweaters (some lose >1.5 L sweat/hour with ~1 g sodium/L). Without replacement, blood sodium can drop, leading to hyponatremia, or at least muscle cramps, fatigue, or dizziness. **Sodium is the most critical electrolyte to replace** during marathons because it’s lost in the greatest amount. It maintains blood volume and helps prevent dehydration. Potassium, magnesium, and calcium also play roles in muscle function, but sodium imbalance is the primary acute concern in a marathon.

**Hydration & Sodium Strategy:** Both elite and recreational marathoners need individualized hydration plans that include electrolytes. Their approaches may differ: elites tolerate slight dehydration (finishing 2–4% body weight down) to avoid excess weight, and they have access to personal bottles with precise electrolytes. Recreational runners, especially slower ones, are at higher risk of *over*-drinking water without enough sodium, causing dilutional hyponatremia. Indeed, most severe hyponatremia cases occur in marathoners who drink too much plain water over many hours. Therefore, guidelines emphasize drinking **to thirst** or at a moderate rate, and including sodium to match sweat losses, rather than forcing fluids. The ACSM suggests ~**400–800 mL of fluid per hour** for marathon-like activities, adjusted for conditions. Faster/heavier runners in heat will be on the higher end; slower/lighter runners in cool conditions on the lower end. 

Within that fluid, include **sodium** for runs over ~2 hours. A guideline is **300–600 mg sodium per hour**, more if very heavy sweating. For example, if a runner drinks a sports drink with ~200 mg sodium per 8 oz, and they sip ~16 oz (0.5 L) per hour, they’ll get ~400–500 mg sodium/hour – in the recommended range. Many gels and sports drinks provide sodium. Runners who know they sweat salt (salt crust on skin/clothes, frequent cramping) might take salt capsules (~200–300 mg each) during the race to boost intake. Practice in training to dial this in – for instance, weigh yourself before/after a long run to estimate sweat rate, and note salt residue. 

**Electrolytes & Performance:** Keeping sodium in balance helps preserve **plasma volume**, so the heart can effectively pump blood to muscles and skin (cooling). If a runner only drinks water and dilutes their sodium, they may get headaches, nausea, or cramps due to disrupted nerve-muscle function. Conversely, dehydration (under-drinking) raises heart rate and perceived exertion. So it’s a balance: drink enough to minimize dehydration, but don’t overdrink; and **make sure fluids contain electrolytes**. Elite runners often finish slightly dehydrated but started well-hydrated and drank at aid stations; they also avoid hyponatremia by using sports drinks and shorter race times. Recreational runners should consciously include electrolytes if running over ~2 hours. This could mean alternating water with sports drink, or adding electrolyte tablets to their water. 

**Other Electrolytes:** **Potassium** is also lost in sweat, though in smaller amounts than sodium. Most sports drinks include potassium (~50–100 mg per serving) to help with muscle cell function. A balanced diet (fruits, veggies) usually covers potassium needs; for example, bananas and oranges are rich in K and often offered during races. **Magnesium** and **calcium** are lost in trace amounts in sweat. They are typically replenished after the race via food. Some runners prone to cramp take a magnesium supplement during training (as discussed), but acute Mg intake during a marathon isn’t common (excess Mg can cause GI upset). Calcium needs to be met in daily diet (around 1000 mg/day) for bone health, but acute replacement during a race is not necessary. Ensuring sufficient calcium and vitamin D overall is crucial to prevent stress fractures, but that’s a long-term nutrition aspect, not in-race.

**Summary (Electrolytes):** In a marathon, emphasize **sodium replacement and sensible hydration**. Use sports drinks or salty foods (pretzels, broth) during the race, aiming for fluids that provide ~0.5–0.7 g sodium per liter (which is typical of sports drinks). Adjust to your sweat rate and weather – a heavy sweater in heat may need the high end or more (and might do a pre-race salt load, like a sports drink or salty meal the night before, to boost sodium stores), while a slow runner in cool weather might get by with the low end. The goal is to **finish neither severely dehydrated nor overhydrated** – avoid >3–4% body weight loss (performance suffers) and avoid weight gain (risk of hyponatremia). Including sodium helps you strike this balance safely. It also helps you **perform better** by maintaining muscle function and reducing cramp risk (though not all cramps are electrolyte-related). In practical terms: drink to thirst using sports drinks, take salt caps if you have very salty sweat or in hot conditions, and rehydrate with electrolytes after the race. 

### Other Micronutrients to Note  
- **Calcium & Vitamin D:** Important for bone density and muscle function. Marathoners put repetitive stress on bones; adequate calcium (~1000 mg/day for adults, more for teens/masters) and vitamin D (~800–2000 IU/day or as needed to maintain 25(OH)D levels in a good range) help prevent stress fractures and support muscle contraction. Female athletes with menstrual dysfunction (low energy availability) are at high risk for low bone density – they especially need sufficient calcium and D. Include calcium-rich foods daily: dairy (milk, yogurt, cheese) or fortified plant milks, tofu, leafy greens, almonds. For vitamin D, sensible sun exposure and/or supplements can maintain levels if you’re deficient (common in winter or northern latitudes). Many elites monitor vitamin D status and supplement if needed. Recreational runners who train indoors or in winter should consider a vitamin D supplement (blood test can confirm a deficiency). Strong bones are literally the foundation of consistent marathon training.
- **Zinc:** Involved in immunity, recovery, and energy metabolism. Endurance exercise can increase zinc losses (through sweat and urine), and low zinc can reduce endurance and impair recovery. Good sources are meat, shellfish, dairy, whole grains, and nuts. Most balanced diets provide enough (~8–11 mg/day), but athletes restricting intake or vegetarians (due to lower absorption from plant foods) should ensure adequate zinc. Frequent colds or slow wound healing could hint at low zinc. A multivitamin often has zinc, which can serve as insurance if diet might be low. However, avoid high-dose zinc supplements unless needed – too much zinc can cause nausea and interfere with copper absorption.
- **B-Vitamins:** B vitamins (like B1, B2, B3, B6, B12, folate) are key for converting food to energy and for red blood cell production. Marathoners have elevated needs because of greater energy turnover and tissue repair. Usually, a varied diet with whole grains, lean proteins, and vegetables suffices. For example, B12 is in animal foods (meat, dairy), folate in leafy greens and beans, B6 in poultry and bananas, B1/B2 in whole grains and legumes. Vegetarian and especially vegan runners need a reliable B12 source (supplement or fortified foods), since B12 is only in animal products. Low B12 or folate can cause anemia similarly to iron, so they’re important. If an athlete feels chronically fatigued, it’s worth checking B12/folate levels in addition to iron. In general, hitting 100% of the RDA for all B vitamins is recommended (a basic multivitamin can cover this, or targeted supplementation if a deficiency is identified). 
- **Antioxidants & Immune Support:** Vitamins C and E, beta-carotene, selenium, and plant polyphenols help quench oxidative stress from intense exercise. Marathon training produces free radicals that can contribute to muscle soreness and inflammation. Emphasize a **“eat the rainbow”** approach: fruits (berries, citrus, cherries), vegetables (leafy greens, bell peppers, tomatoes, carrots), nuts/seeds, and whole grains provide a spectrum of antioxidants. These nutrients support the immune system, which is often taxed by heavy training. For example, vitamin C-rich foods (citrus, kiwi, peppers) can support collagen formation and immunity, vitamin E (nuts, seeds, wheat germ) protects cell membranes from oxidative damage, and selenium (found in nuts, seafood) is part of antioxidant enzymes. That said, **avoid megadoses of antioxidant supplements** around training – high-dose C or E pills can blunt some training adaptations by interfering with the body’s natural stress signals. It’s better to get antioxidants from food. Tart cherry juice is one specific antioxidant-rich food that has evidence for reducing post-exercise inflammation and muscle soreness, which some marathoners use in recovery. Probiotics (in yogurt, kefir, or supplements) can also support gut and immune health during heavy training. 
- **Electrolytes (Potassium, Magnesium, etc.):** We covered sodium in depth. **Potassium** needs (4700 mg/day general recommendation) are met by eating plenty of fruits and vegetables (bananas, potatoes, oranges, etc.). Potassium works with sodium to maintain fluid balance and proper muscle function; deficiency is rare with a decent diet, but ensure you’re not skimping on produce. **Magnesium** we discussed – daily needs ~300–400 mg (addressed above). **Iron** we discussed – meet those needs to avoid anemia. Essentially, aim for a **balanced diet with variety**, and most micronutrient needs will be covered. If dietary variety is limited (due to allergies, vegetarianism, or heavy weight-loss dieting), consider working with a dietitian to find suitable food sources or supplements for any at-risk nutrients.

In summary, maintaining micronutrient adequacy is a cornerstone of marathon nutrition. Elites often get regular blood work to monitor things like iron, vitamin D, B12, etc., and fine-tune accordingly. Recreational runners should not overlook these “small” nutrients – a simple yearly blood test for iron status and vitamin D can preempt performance issues. Eating a nutrient-dense diet (lean proteins, whole grains, and *lots* of vegetables and fruits) is the best strategy to ensure vitamins and minerals are in place to support training. A multi-vitamin/mineral can be a safety net if dietary intake is marginal (though it’s not a substitute for real food), especially during heavy training when it’s easy to run a deficit in something. Ultimately, a well-nourished marathoner will not only perform better but also stay healthier and more consistent in training. “**Food first**” – get your nutrients from quality food – and use supplements only to address specific gaps or needs.

## Evidence-Based Supplements for Endurance Performance  

Beyond whole foods, certain **ergogenic aids** (performance-enhancing supplements) have strong scientific support in endurance sports like marathoning. Here we detail several supplements with evidence-based benefits: **caffeine**, **creatine**, **electrolytes** (sodium supplementation), **beta-alanine**, and **nitrates** (beetroot juice). These have been researched extensively and, when used appropriately, can provide a competitive edge or assist in meeting nutrition needs. It’s important to note that individual responses vary, and supplements should be tested in training before race day. Also, supplements *supplement* a good diet – they don’t compensate for poor eating. Both elite and recreational runners use these aids, though access and usage may vary (e.g. nearly all elite marathoners strategically use caffeine, while some recreational runners might not). We describe each and highlight any differences in how elites vs. recreational runners might approach them.

### Caffeine  
**How It Works:** Caffeine is one of the most well-proven performance enhancers in endurance sports. It’s a stimulant affecting the central nervous system and muscles. By blocking adenosine receptors in the brain, caffeine reduces the perception of effort and fatigue, allowing a runner to maintain a hard pace longer before feeling exhausted. It also increases release of adrenaline, improving alertness and perhaps aiding fat utilization (slightly sparing glycogen, though this effect is minor at marathon intensities). Caffeine can directly enhance muscle fiber activation and calcium release in muscle cells, improving contractility. The net result is improved endurance performance – typically seen as the ability to sustain pace longer or complete a time trial faster. Many studies and meta-analyses confirm that moderate caffeine doses increase time-to-exhaustion and improve performance in events from 5K to marathon. 

**Usage Guidelines:** A commonly effective dose is **3–6 mg of caffeine per kg body weight**, taken **30–90 minutes before** exercise. For a 70 kg runner, that’s ~210–420 mg of caffeine – roughly 2–4 cups of coffee or 1–2 caffeine pills (most pills are 200 mg). Taking caffeine ~1 hour pre-race allows blood levels to peak as the race starts. Many runners use coffee (e.g. an elite might have a strong coffee ~60 min pre-gun) or caffeine gels/chews. It’s wise to start at the lower end (~3 mg/kg) to gauge effect and tolerance. Higher doses above ~6 mg/kg usually don’t yield extra benefit but increase risk of side effects. In fact, >9 mg/kg can cause jitters, GI distress, and other issues without improving performance. Most guidelines suggest not exceeding ~400 mg caffeine total (for reference, a Starbucks Grande coffee has ~310 mg). **Lower doses (1–2 mg/kg)** can still help with alertness if someone is very caffeine-sensitive – even ~100 mg (an espresso or caffeinated gel) can improve endurance in some studies. 

**During the Race:** In marathons, some runners take additional caffeine mid-race to sustain its effects, especially if they’re on the course for over 3–4 hours. Caffeine’s half-life is ~5 hours, so a pre-race dose covers most of a marathon for elites. Recreational runners (4–5 hour finishers) might benefit from a “caffeine top-up” in the later miles. For example, around the 20-mile mark (~3 hours in), one might take ~50–100 mg via a caffeinated gel or chew. Research in cycling showed a small caffeine dose (~1.5–3 mg/kg) partway through a 3-hour effort improved subsequent performance. It’s important not to overdo total intake; the goal is to maintain benefits, not double-dose. Caffeine gum (which is absorbed through the mouth) can give a quick boost if taken in the final miles. Always practice any mid-race caffeine in training to ensure no GI upset or excessive jitters occur.

**Performance Benefits:** Caffeine offers a modest but significant performance boost. It can improve **time-trial performance and endurance capacity** by a few percentage points. For example, a meta-analysis noted ~2–4% improvement in endurance performance with caffeine. In a marathon, 2–4% could be 2–5 minutes for a 3-hour marathoner – quite meaningful. Caffeine also improves mental alertness and mood, which helps with pacing and pushing through discomfort. Additionally, caffeine taken with carbohydrates has a synergistic effect: studies show that consuming caffeine plus carbs during exercise leads to better performance than carbs alone. Many marathoners leverage this by using caffeinated sports gels/drinks, which provide both energy and stimulation.

**Individual Differences:** People vary in their caffeine sensitivity and metabolism. Genetics (e.g. CYP1A2 gene variants) influence whether someone responds strongly or weakly. About 10% of people might not experience performance benefits (“non-responders”), or they may get more side effects. Regular caffeine consumers still benefit from an acute dose, though some early research suggested the effect might diminish with daily use. Recent evidence indicates habitual caffeine intake doesn’t eliminate the performance boost of a pre-race dose. In other words, you don’t need to go through caffeine withdrawal to get the benefit – you can have your daily coffee and still get an ergogenic effect from a race-morning coffee. However, very high habitual intake might reduce the boost slightly. Ultimately, it’s personal – some athletes cycle off caffeine pre-race to heighten sensitivity, others find it unnecessary. What’s clear is that acute caffeine before exercise improves performance regardless of habitual use in most people.

**Cautions:** Excess caffeine can cause **GI distress**, anxiety, and insomnia. Runners prone to pre-race nerves or IBS should be cautious – test what your stomach can handle. If coffee triggers bathroom trips or cramps, consider caffeine in other forms (gel, pill, tea) and at a lower dose. Caffeine used to be banned over certain thresholds, but it’s now permitted in competition (though very high doses could still trigger a positive doping test for caffeine in some sports, so elite athletes monitor total intake to stay below ~9 mg/kg to be safe). Also, note that caffeine is a mild diuretic at rest, but during exercise this effect is blunted – studies find no evidence that moderate caffeine dehydrates athletes or impairs heat tolerance. So the old advice to avoid coffee for fear of dehydration is outdated, at least for moderate doses. Still, always accompany caffeine with some water to be safe.

**Elite vs Recreational Use:** Nearly all **elite marathoners** incorporate caffeine – typically ~3–4 mg/kg pre-race via coffee or caffeine supplements, because at their level even a 1% gain is huge. Many will have it in their first bottles or gels too. **Recreational runners** stand to benefit just as much. If you’re a coffee drinker, don’t skip your normal morning cup on race day (unless it causes issues) – it can actually help performance. If you’re not a coffee person, consider a caffeinated gel (usually ~20–40 mg) at some point in the race. Even that small dose can sharpen you up. For those who are very sensitive (get jittery easily), maybe use a smaller dose (like green tea or half a caffeine tablet for ~100 mg). The key is to make sure any caffeine strategy is practiced and you’re comfortable with it. In summary, **caffeine (3–6 mg/kg taken ~1 hour pre-run)** is a highly effective, well-researched ergogenic aid for endurance, and both elites and recreational runners can leverage it to run faster or feel better during the marathon.

### Creatine  
**What It Is:** Creatine monohydrate is a popular supplement typically associated with strength and power sports. It increases muscle phosphocreatine stores, enhancing the ability to rapidly regenerate ATP during high-intensity, short-duration efforts. At first glance, creatine might not seem relevant to a marathon, which is an aerobic endurance event. However, emerging research suggests creatine can offer benefits for endurance athletes indirectly – by improving high-intensity segments within an endurance effort (surges, sprint finishes) and by aiding recovery and glycogen storage.

**How It Helps Endurance:** When an endurance athlete takes creatine, muscle creatine and phosphocreatine levels rise ~15–20%. This doesn’t directly make someone run longer aerobically, but it boosts capacity for **repeated high-intensity bursts**. In a marathon, this could matter for surging to pass competitors, powering up a hill, or kicking in the final 400m. A 2023 review noted creatine supplementation appears to help most in endurance performances that **require multiple surges or a strong end spurt** ([

        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10132248/#:~:text=effects%2C%20particularly%20in%20weight,mixed%3B%20however%2C%20creatine%20supplementation%20appears)). Essentially, creatine can improve the “anaerobic reserve” during an otherwise aerobic event. It also has been shown to **increase time to exhaustion in high-intensity endurance activities**, likely by enhancing anaerobic work capacity (you can push hard for longer before fatigue) ([
            Creatine supplementation and endurance performance: surges and sprints to win the race - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10132248/#:~:text=effects%2C%20particularly%20in%20weight,mixed%3B%20however%2C%20creatine%20supplementation%20appears)). 

Creatine offers other potential benefits for endurance folks:
- **Enhanced Glycogen Storage:** Creatine, especially when co-ingested with carbs, can increase muscle glycogen content ([
            Creatine supplementation and endurance performance: surges and sprints to win the race - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10132248/#:~:text=co,In%20contrast%2C%20creatine)). One study found that after creatine loading, muscles stored more glycogen during carb-loading than without creatine. Since marathoners rely on maximal glycogen stores, this could translate to a fuel advantage on race day.
- **Improved Recovery:** Creatine has cell-protective effects – it can reduce inflammation and muscle damage markers after intense exercise ([
            Creatine supplementation and endurance performance: surges and sprints to win the race - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10132248/#:~:text=co,In%20contrast%2C%20creatine)). By acting as a pH buffer and antioxidant, creatine might speed recovery between hard training sessions. It may also help maintain muscle mass during heavy endurance training, which can sometimes cause muscle catabolism.
- **Thermal & Cognitive Benefits:** Some research (and much anecdote) suggests creatine might help with thermoregulation and mental fatigue. It also can aid hydration of muscles (since it pulls water into muscle cells), which might be a minor benefit in staying hydrated.

**The Downside – Weight Gain:** The main caveat: creatine usually causes a small **increase in body weight** (1–2 kg) due to water retention in muscles, and possibly a bit of muscle fiber growth with training. In weight-bearing sports like running, extra weight can slow you down – an important consideration for elites who are very lean and optimize every pound. For some runners, the performance benefits might not outweigh even a slight weight gain. However, not everyone gains a lot of weight, and some might gain 1–2 lb that’s mostly water (which could even help with hydration). A few studies on runners and cyclists showed mixed results partly for this reason: if a runner gains 2% body weight from creatine, the improved power might be offset by the extra load to carry. But if they only gain 1 lb and improve finishing kick, it could be net positive.

A review noted that the potential weight gain “may offset the positive effects” in weight-bearing exercise, but also that creatine’s benefits (e.g. better glycogen, anaerobic capacity) **could still yield a net gain in performance**. Each athlete should gauge this. Some strategies to mitigate weight concerns: do a slow creatine load (less abrupt water retention), time the usage (e.g. in training block but not right up to race day), and monitor body comp.

**How to Use:** Standard creatine usage is either a **loading protocol** (20 g/day split into 4 doses for 5–7 days, then 3–5 g/day maintenance) or a consistent low dose (3–5 g daily for ~4 weeks to saturate muscles similarly). The outcome is the same, though loading saturates muscles within a week whereas low-dose takes ~28 days. Endurance athletes might prefer the gradual approach to avoid sudden weight increase and GI upset that high doses can cause. Many will maintain 3–5 g/day after loading to keep stores elevated. It’s often done in cycles. For example, a marathoner might load creatine in the early training phase to help with high-intensity workouts or gym sessions, then stop a couple of weeks before the race to drop any extra water weight (it takes a few weeks for creatine levels to fall off, so a short stop may not lose all benefits). Some might continue low-dose through race day, banking on more pros than cons.

It’s crucial to **stay well-hydrated** when using creatine, since it shifts fluid into muscles. Also, taking creatine with carbs or a meal can improve uptake and reduce any stomach discomfort.

**Performance Evidence:** Pure endurance (steady-state time trials) show mixed responses to creatine. Some studies found no improvement in 5k or 10k times – likely because the weight gain offset any benefit or because the events had no surges. However, in scenarios with sprint finishes or interval tests, creatine often shows improvement. For example, creatine loading has improved final sprint performance after prolonged cycling ([

        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10132248/#:~:text=effects%2C%20particularly%20in%20weight,mixed%3B%20however%2C%20creatine%20supplementation%20appears)). In another study, creatine plus carbs allowed cyclists to store more glycogen, which in a real event could delay fatigue. Also, creatine’s effect on **strength** can benefit marathoners in training: being stronger can improve running economy (the muscles produce required force more efficiently). Some marathoners use creatine in training to support their strength training regimen, then taper off if they worry about weight. 

For **recreational runners**, creatine might be quite beneficial if they also play sports or do intervals, as it helps those high-intensity efforts. Additionally, many recreational runners are masters athletes; creatine is known to help older athletes counter age-related muscle loss and could help masters marathoners maintain muscle and power.

**Bottom Line:** Creatine is a **well-researched, generally safe supplement** with potential benefits for marathoners in terms of glycogen storage, sprint capacity, and recovery ([
            Creatine supplementation and endurance performance: surges and sprints to win the race - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10132248/#:~:text=effects%2C%20particularly%20in%20weight,mixed%3B%20however%2C%20creatine%20supplementation%20appears)). The caveat is possible weight gain. Elites who are extremely weight-conscious may avoid it, but some elites (especially those who do shorter races too) use it strategically. Recreational runners can experiment during training – if you gain minimal weight and feel stronger, it might be worth continuing. If you feel bloated or heavy, you can drop it. 

Importantly, creatine won’t improve your steady aerobic pace directly, but it can **enhance the quality of training and the ability to surge during races**, which indirectly helps performance. Also, as a recovery aid, it might allow you to train more consistently. As the literature suggests, creatine particularly shines in races with changes of pace or an end spurt ([
            Creatine supplementation and endurance performance: surges and sprints to win the race - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10132248/#:~:text=effects%2C%20particularly%20in%20weight,mixed%3B%20however%2C%20creatine%20supplementation%20appears)) – if that’s part of your racing (for example, trying to outkick someone at the finish or even just powering through The Wall), creatine could help. For someone just trying to finish, it might not be as impactful, but the recovery and glycogen benefits could still be nice.

If trying creatine, give it a full trial in training (at least 4–6 weeks on 5 g/day) and monitor how you feel running with it. If the benefits (stronger strides, better interval performance) are noticeable and any weight gain is minimal/manageable, you can incorporate it into your nutrition plan. If not, it’s something you can skip. Since creatine is relatively inexpensive and one of the most studied supplements (with a strong safety profile), it’s a viable option in the endurance athlete’s toolbox.

### Electrolytes (Salt Supplements)  
*Note:* We covered electrolytes (sodium) in Micronutrients, but it’s worth re-emphasizing as a “supplement” strategy because intentional electrolyte intake during marathons is critical for performance and safety.

**Why:** During a marathon, especially in warm weather, significant **sodium loss** occurs. Supplementing electrolytes (particularly sodium) during the race is evidence-based to prevent hyponatremia and maintain performance in events >2 hours. Including sodium doesn’t so much “boost” performance above normal as it **prevents performance decline** from dehydration or electrolyte imbalance. In other words, it’s about sustaining your potential rather than gaining extra beyond your training. Nonetheless, for practical purposes, taking salt can be seen as an ergogenic aid in endurance events.

**How to Implement:** Ensure your **hydration plan includes sodium**. This can be via:
- **Sports drinks:** Drink the provided sports drink at aid stations (they’re formulated with sodium ~200–400 mg per cup). Don’t rely solely on plain water; alternate if you carry water, or primarily drink the sports drink offered.
- **Electrolyte capsules:** If you prefer water or the race provides only low-sodium drink, consider salt capsules (e.g. 1–2 capsules per hour, each ~200–300 mg sodium, with water). This is common in ultras but also used by marathoners in hot climates. 
- **Salty snacks or gels:** Choose gels that have sodium (~100 mg or more per gel) or eat a few pretzels at aid stations (some races offer them). Some energy chews (like Shot Bloks margarita flavor) have extra salt.

For example, one might take a salt pill at the halfway point and 20 miles. Or if using a Camelbak with water, drop an electrolyte tablet in it. The idea is to target ~300–600 mg sodium/hour, adjusting to personal sweat rates. Practice this in training: on a 3-hour run, you might test drinking a liter of Gatorade (~1100 mg Na) vs. water + salt pills to see what keeps you feeling best.

**Electrolyte Loading:** Some runners do a bit of pre-race salt “loading” – not as formal as carb-loading, but for instance, having a salty meal the night before (soy sauce on pasta or extra salt on potatoes) and maybe a sports drink the morning of (or sodium loading products like Precision Hydration packets). This can increase plasma volume slightly and start you off well-hydrated. Just avoid going overboard where it causes bloating or high blood pressure – a moderate increase in salt and fluid intake pre-race is fine if you expect heavy sweating.

**Effects:** By maintaining electrolyte balance, you **sustain better muscle function and hydration**. Runners who don’t replace sodium risk hyponatremia symptoms (nausea, headache, confusion) especially if they’re drinking a lot of water. On the performance side, a well-hydrated muscle with proper electrolyte levels contracts more efficiently and is less likely to cramp (though cramping has multiple causes). Proper sodium intake also keeps you thirsty enough to drink appropriate fluids; without sodium, you might either under-drink (due to lack of thirst) or over-drink water (leading to dilution). As one position stand notes, athletes with high sweat rates or “salty sweat” benefit from sodium intake during exercise, and average sweat sodium is ~1 g/L, so ingesting ~0.5 g/L is a good starting point. 

**Elite vs Recreational:** Elites have individualized hydration protocols and typically use specially mixed drinks to match their sweat losses (some weigh themselves in training to get sweat rates, and may even have sweat composition tested). For instance, an elite might drink 500 mL/hour of a drink with 700 mg sodium if they know they lose 1000 mg/h, choosing to replace ~70% of losses. Recreational runners often have to rely on general strategies: using on-course drinks and maybe carrying supplementary electrolytes. A recreational runner is more likely to run into trouble by *overdrinking* water (trying to prevent dehydration but inadvertently causing hyponatremia). So for them, the mantra is “drink to thirst, and make sure some of that is sports drink.” They should avoid taking in more fluid than they sweat out. A good check is urine after the race – clear urine plus weight gain implies overhydration; dark urine and weight loss implies dehydration. The best plan prevents both extremes.

**Recovery Electrolytes:** After the marathon, rehydration with sodium is critical. Aim for foods like soup, salted crackers, pickles, or electrolyte beverages. The goal is to fully restore fluid and salt to recover quickly. The guideline is ~1.5 L fluid per kg weight lost, with sodium (like ~2–3 g spread out) to retain it.

In summary, **electrolyte supplementation (especially sodium)** is an integral part of marathon nutrition. It won’t make you “faster” per se, but it allows you to **perform at your best for longer** by avoiding dehydration and electrolyte disturbances. It’s one of those things where when done right you might not notice it, but when done wrong (like no salt, or over-salting without water) the negative effects are obvious. Both elites and recreational runners should plan their salt/fluid intake just as carefully as their carb intake. Essentially, treat sodium as a required nutrient during the race, not an optional one. As you plan how many gels to take, also plan how to get ~salt each hour – whether through the gels, drinks, or tablets, ensure it’s there. This way, you give yourself the best chance to avoid cramping and keep your head clear, especially in the later miles when dehydration and hyponatremia can really hit.

### Beta-Alanine  
**What It Is:** Beta-alanine is an amino acid that, when supplemented, increases muscle **carnosine** levels. Carnosine acts as a buffer, soaking up hydrogen ions (H+) produced during high-intensity exercise, thus delaying the drop in pH (acidosis) in muscles. Beta-alanine is well proven to improve performance in intense efforts lasting ~1–4 minutes (like a 800m or 1500m run) by enhancing buffering capacity. A marathon is typically run at an intensity low enough that large H+ accumulation isn’t the primary limiter until perhaps the very end or during surges. So beta-alanine is less directly impactful on a marathon than on middle-distance events. However, it could still help in *certain* scenarios within a marathon or in training.

**Why Consider It for Marathoning:** 
- **High-Intensity Sections:** If your marathon involves pushing above lactate threshold at times (for instance, a fast start, bridging a gap, or a hard finish), beta-alanine’s buffering can help those efforts feel easier and produce less fatigue. It might give you a little more gas in the final miles when you try to kick or tackle a steep bridge, as your muscles won’t acidify quite as quickly.
- **Training Benefits:** Beta-alanine could help you in your speed workouts, tempo runs, or shorter races leading up to the marathon. By buffering acid, you can potentially sustain a hard pace slightly longer in interval sessions, leading to better training quality. Over time, that can mean improved fitness. Many marathoners run tune-up races (5Ks, 10Ks, half-marathons); beta-alanine can improve performance in those (where intensities are higher than marathon pace). That can indirectly boost marathon readiness.
- **Recovery and Other Effects:** There’s some evidence that carnosine has antioxidant properties. So raising carnosine might also help with quenching reactive oxygen species and thus recovery, though this is not as clearly established as the performance angle.

**Evidence in Endurance:** The majority of positive beta-alanine studies are in exercise bursts under 10 minutes. For longer, continuous exercise, the results are mixed. Some found slight improvements, others none. One study did show improved 10K run performance (~1 hour effort) after beta-alanine loading, with lower lactate levels post-run ([
            Beta-Alanine Supplementation Improved 10-km Running Time Trial in Physically Active Adults - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6092497/#:~:text=showing%20an%20association%20between%20lower,to%20lower%20blood%20lactate%20accumulation)). This implies the runners were able to run at the same pace with less anaerobic contribution (more efficient use of their aerobic capacity, perhaps). Another study in cyclists showed ~2.5% improvement in a 60-minute time trial with beta-alanine. On the other hand, some research on longer events (like 20km cycling or marathon simulation) shows minimal effect.

A key meta-analysis (2017) concluded beta-alanine yields a **2–3% performance improvement in recreational athletes** in high-intensity continuous efforts, but only ~0.5–1% in elite athletes. So, a non-elite has more to gain because their anaerobic contribution at a given relative intensity is often higher (they may accumulate more lactate at marathon pace than an elite would). Elites are so efficient and have so high thresholds that beta-alanine’s effect is smaller.

So, a recreational marathoner who is maybe running at 80% VO₂max (and accumulating some lactate) could see a slight benefit in later miles from beta-alanine, whereas an elite at 90% VO₂max but extremely well-trained may have less of an issue with acidosis except in a final sprint.

**How to Use:** Beta-alanine requires **chronic loading**. A typical regimen: 4–6 g per day (in 2 doses of 2–3 g) for at least 4 weeks, up to 12 weeks. This gradually elevates muscle carnosine. Effects are usually seen after ~4 weeks of consistent use. Maintenance can be 1.5–2 g/day after loading. Many do a continuous cycle for several months in season. Splitting doses helps avoid or lessen the tingling (paresthesia) that beta-alanine can cause – taking 1.5 g four times a day is less tingly than 3 g twice, for instance. Some newer slow-release formulas reduce this as well.

**Performance Outcomes:** If loaded properly, beta-alanine can allow an athlete to maintain a given high intensity a bit longer. In a marathon context, this might manifest as being able to *slightly* delay the onset of that debilitating fatigue in the final 5K, especially if pushing the pace. It might also slightly improve your critical velocity or lactate threshold pace in training over time. The improvements are modest – you’re not suddenly running 10 minutes faster – but at competitive levels or for PR-chasers, even 1–2% is valuable.

**Other Considerations:** Beta-alanine supplementation is very safe aside from the flushing/tingling sensation (which is harmless and subsides after a while or by using slow-release). It doesn’t cause weight gain or GI issues typically. The main investment is remembering to take it daily for weeks. It might be more beneficial for those who have a lot of fast-twitch fibers or for older athletes (some evidence suggests older adults get a bigger relative boost, possibly due to lower baseline carnosine). Also, vegetarians tend to have lower muscle carnosine (because carnosine is found in meat) – so vegetarian runners could benefit more from beta-alanine loading to make up that gap.

**Elite vs Recreational Use:** Some elite marathoners might not bother with beta-alanine if they don’t feel it helps at their level or if they don’t like taking a lot of supplements. But some do use it, especially if they also run track races or if they’re seeking every edge. Elites like track cyclists or rowers use it widely; it’s lesser but still present among elite distance runners. Recreational competitive runners might see a more noticeable effect, and since it’s safe, many coaches and sports nutritionists would categorize it as “worth trying if you want a small boost.” The ISSN considers it one of a handful of supplements with good evidence for performance (just behind creatine and caffeine in terms of evidence strength).

In summary, **beta-alanine can slightly enhance endurance performance by improving muscle buffering capacity**, which is more pronounced in high-intensity efforts ([
            Beta-Alanine Supplementation Improved 10-km Running Time Trial in Physically Active Adults - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6092497/#:~:text=showing%20an%20association%20between%20lower,to%20lower%20blood%20lactate%20accumulation)). In marathons, the benefits are subtle – possibly helping in the final miles or during surges – and likely more so for recreational runners than elites. It’s not as critical as fueling or hydration, but it’s an option for those looking to optimize. If you decide to use it, start supplementation at least a month before your race, and be consistent. If you’ve done that and your training times (like tempo runs) are a tad better or you feel less burn in hard efforts, you can surmise it’s working. If you notice no difference, you might skip it next time. As with all supplements: individual variability is a factor, but generally beta-alanine is one of the “small but potentially useful” tools in an endurance athlete’s kit.

### Nitrates (Beetroot Juice)  
**What It Is:** Nitrate (NO₃⁻)-rich supplements (typically **beetroot juice** or shots) have gained popularity for their endurance benefits. The body converts dietary nitrate to nitrite and then to **nitric oxide (NO)**, a molecule that causes blood vessels to dilate and helps regulate muscle efficiency and mitochondrial function. A pivotal 2009 study found that beetroot juice allowed cyclists to use less oxygen at a given workload (improved efficiency), and since then numerous studies have explored nitrates in endurance performance.

**Benefits for Endurance:** The main effect of nitrate supplementation is **improved exercise efficiency** – muscles require slightly less oxygen to produce the same power output. This translates to better **running economy** for runners. With improved economy, a given pace uses a smaller fraction of your VO₂max, effectively “boosting” endurance. Nitrates also can enhance blood flow to muscles (via NO-mediated vasodilation), improve muscle contractile function, and possibly help in muscle force production at low oxygen levels. Many studies have shown:
- Reduced O₂ cost (≈3–5% less oxygen needed) at submaximal intensities.
- Increased time to exhaustion in constant-load tests.
- Improved performance in time trials, especially those lasting 5–30 minutes, and particularly in less trained individuals ([
            Nutrition and Supplement Update for the Endurance Athlete: Review and Recommendations - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6628334/#:~:text=can%20improve%20muscle%20economy%2C%20efficiency,12%20%2C%2072%2C52%20%2C%2074)).
For example, one study showed cyclists improved a 4km and 16km time trial after beetroot juice, and runners have shown improvements in 5K times by ~1–2% in some research.

For a marathon, which is a longer effort, nitrates might help by **conserving energy** early on and delaying fatigue. If your muscles are, say, 5% more efficient, you theoretically use 5% less glycogen and produce 5% less lactate at the same pace – over 2–4 hours, that could delay hitting the wall or allow a slightly faster pace for the same effort. 

**Mixed Results in Elites:** As noted, many studies find **bigger benefits in recreational or sub-elite athletes** than in elites ([
            Nutrition and Supplement Update for the Endurance Athlete: Review and Recommendations - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6628334/#:~:text=can%20improve%20muscle%20economy%2C%20efficiency,12%20%2C%2072%2C52%20%2C%2074)). Possible reasons: elite athletes may already have a diet naturally high in nitrates (lots of veggies) and higher baseline NO bioavailability; their muscles might already be super efficient leaving less room for improvement; and some studies even suggest very fit athletes might not respond as much to acute nitrate dosing. However, some elite-level performances have been aided by nitrates – e.g., there’s anecdotal evidence and some data that elite rowers and cyclists do use beetroot shots. 

Even if elites get a smaller % gain (say 0.5–1%), that can be meaningful for them. For recreational runners, a 1–3% performance boost is more plausible from nitrates, which is significant (could be a few minutes in a marathon). Also, nitrates might help more in situations of low oxygen availability (like high altitude or very hot conditions). 

**How to Take:** Standard practice is **500 ml of beetroot juice (~2 cups)** or a concentrated beetroot shot (~70 ml) containing ~300–600 mg nitrate, taken about **2–3 hours pre-exercise**. This timing allows conversion to NO to peak around the time you’re in the race. Some newer findings suggest a timing tweak: ingesting ~90 minutes before might align better with peak plasma nitrite at the start of exercise ([
            Nutrition and Supplement Update for the Endurance Athlete: Review and Recommendations - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6628334/#:~:text=results,suboptimal%20time%20interval%20for%20exercise)), but generally 2 hours out is fine. The exact dose can vary; studies use anywhere from ~300 mg nitrate (around 0.1 mmol/kg) up to 600+ mg. Often, one 70 ml beetroot shot is ~300 mg; some protocols use two shots (~600 mg).

Another approach is **nitrate loading**: consuming a high-nitrate diet or supplement for several days leading up to the event. For example, drinking 500 ml beet juice each day for 3 days prior, plus one dose on race day morning. This can increase muscle nitrate stores more than a single dose, potentially giving a more sustained effect. In one study, 6 days of high-nitrate diet improved exercise performance more than a single dose. So, an elite might start beet juice daily in race week. However, too much for too long can cause the body to adapt (counter-regulate NO production), so usually a week is sufficient.

**Dietary vs Supplement:** You could just eat foods like **spinach, arugula, celery, beets** leading up to the race – e.g. a big spinach salad, beet smoothies, etc. They are high in nitrate and can achieve similar intake if eaten in large amounts (e.g. 3–4 small beets or 2 cups cooked spinach might have ~300–400 mg nitrate). But the juice or shots are convenient and more precise. One practical compromise: include nitrate-rich veggies daily, and also take a beet shot on race morning.

**Sensory and Side Effects:** Beet juice is generally well tolerated, but some people experience slight stomach upset if they’re not used to it, so **test it in training** (like before a long run). Also, be aware of **beeturia** – red/pink urine – and red stools afterwards; this is harmless, but can be alarming if unexpected. Avoid using strong mouthwash after taking beet juice – killing oral bacteria will impair the conversion of nitrate to nitrite in the mouth and reduce effectiveness. If you must rinse your mouth (some do to get rid of the taste), use water only, not antiseptic mouthwash. Another consideration: nitrate can lower blood pressure a bit, so if you already have low BP or are on blood pressure meds, be cautious and maybe consult a doctor. In healthy athletes, this BP drop is small and not problematic (it might even help reduce cardiac work a tad during exercise).

**Performance Impact:** For a marathon, you might not *feel* anything obvious like you might with caffeine. The effects are more subtle – maybe your breathing is slightly easier at your usual pace, or your heart rate is a tick lower, or you can hold pace in the later miles slightly better. If doing a controlled test, you might see a small improvement in time. A telling observation: many users say that with beet juice, their perceived effort for a given run is a bit lower, and they have “good legs” longer into a hard run.

**Elite vs Recreational Use:** Many recreational runners have jumped on the beetroot bandwagon – it’s a natural supplement and widely accessible (you can even buy beet powder and mix your own drinks). Elites are a bit split; some incorporate it routinely, others have tried it and are neutral. Notably, the 2012 Olympic gold medalist in the men’s 800m, David Rudisha, was reported to drink beetroot juice as part of his routine. Some pro marathoners likely use it as well (perhaps more quietly, as they might consider it a competitive secret). Given it’s legal and safe, it’s a valid part of an elite’s strategy for marginal gains. For recreational runners, it’s an attractive option because it’s basically like drinking a vegetable juice – mentally it feels more “natural” than taking pills, which many find appealing.

**Practical Implementation:** Ideally, test beet juice on a tempo run or long run to ensure no GI upset and to see if you notice any difference. Then for your race:
- In the 2–3 days prior: eat nitrate-rich foods (beetroot, spinach, lettuce, radishes, etc.) or take one beet juice serving each day.
- On race morning: 2 hours before, drink ~300–500 ml beet juice or a concentrated shot (typically ~70 ml, check the brand for nitrate content). If using shots, maybe two shots spaced apart (e.g. one 2.5 hours out, one 1 hour out) – but be mindful not to overdo volume close to start if liquids make you need the bathroom.
- Do not use mouthwash or gum after taking it.
- Continue normal warm-up, etc. You may combine it with caffeine – studies find no negative interactions (caffeine works via different pathways, and one study even showed combined caffeine + nitrate had additive benefits for intense exercise).
- Hydrate normally; beet juice can count towards your fluid intake.

In conclusion, **nitrate supplementation via beetroot juice can enhance endurance by improving muscle efficiency and oxygen utilization**, with many studies supporting performance gains, particularly in non-elite athletes ([
            Nutrition and Supplement Update for the Endurance Athlete: Review and Recommendations - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6628334/#:~:text=can%20improve%20muscle%20economy%2C%20efficiency,elite%20athletes%29%20%5B12%2C51%2C52%2C53)). It’s one of the more “functional food” type supplements that has crossed into mainstream sports nutrition. Considering its safety and potential benefits, it’s worth including in a marathon nutrition plan. At worst, you drank some beet juice and got extra nutrients; at best, you run a stronger race thanks to that nitric oxide boost.

## Ideal Food Examples for Marathon Nutrition  

Translating the science into practice, here are **practical food examples** and meal ideas aligning with the nutritional strategies outlined. We break this into: **Everyday training diet** (how to eat during training weeks) and **Race-day nutrition** – including pre-race, during race, and post-race examples. These examples cater to both elite-level needs (often just larger quantities) and recreational runners (smaller portions, simpler prep). The focus is on whole-food options that meet macro and micronutrient goals, with mention of sports products where they offer convenience.

### Everyday Training Diet Examples  
On a typical training day, marathoners should consume a **high-carbohydrate, moderate-protein, moderate-fat** diet, emphasizing nutrient-dense whole foods. Here’s an example day of meals/snacks:

- **Breakfast:** **Oatmeal with fruit and yogurt** – 1 cup of rolled oats cooked with milk or water, topped with a sliced banana and a handful of berries, plus a spoonful of honey. Serve with 3/4 cup Greek yogurt on the side (or mix it in).  
  *Why:* Oats and fruit provide ~70–90 g of carbs (fuel to start the day and restock liver glycogen) and fiber for sustained energy. Banana adds potassium. Greek yogurt contributes ~15–20 g protein for muscle recovery and calcium. This meal is high-carb but balanced with some protein. It’s a go-to for many runners. (Elites might double the portion; recreational runners might use slightly less oats if their calorie needs are lower.)

- **Mid-Morning Snack:** **Smoothie or toast with nut butter** – For example, a smoothie made with 1 cup berries, 1 banana, a handful of spinach, 1 cup almond milk, and a scoop of protein powder (or Greek yogurt). Alternatively, 2 slices of whole-grain toast with 2 tbsp peanut butter and a drizzle of honey.  
  *Why:* The smoothie provides ~40–50 g carbs (fruit) and ~20 g protein (from powder or yogurt) plus vitamins (vitamin C, iron from spinach). It’s quick to digest before a midday run or as a recovery from an AM workout. The toast with nut butter offers ~30 g carbs (bread, honey) and ~8 g protein + healthy fats (nut butter) – good if you need something solid. Both options top off energy and prevent midday hunger.

- **Lunch:** **Grilled chicken wrap + sweet potato + fruit** – A large whole-wheat tortilla filled with 4–6 oz grilled chicken (or tofu/beans), lettuce, tomato, cucumber, and hummus or light dressing. A medium baked sweet potato on the side (or sweet potato fries baked). Finish with an apple or orange.  
  *Why:* The wrap provides ~40–50 g carbs (tortilla + veggies), ~30 g lean protein (chicken or tofu), and healthy fat if hummus is included. The sweet potato gives an extra ~30 g complex carbs and beta-carotene (antioxidant for recovery). The fruit provides another ~25 g carbs and vitamins/fiber. This meal is high in carbs to refuel lunch, moderate in protein for recovery, and packed with micronutrients. It’s also not too heavy in fat so it won’t cause afternoon sluggishness, which is great if another run is planned.

- **Afternoon Snack:** **Trail mix or yogurt with granola** – 1/4 cup almonds + 1/4 cup dried cranberries + a few pretzels (homemade trail mix), and perhaps a small piece of dark chocolate. Alternatively, 1 cup plain yogurt with 1/3 cup granola and a drizzle of maple syrup.  
  *Why:* Trail mix offers a mix of carbs (dried fruit, pretzels ~20 g), healthy fats and protein (nuts ~6 g protein, ~15 g fat), and sodium (pretzels – good if a lot of sweating occurred). It’s portable and calorie-dense, good for busy athletes. The yogurt-granola is a mini version of the breakfast concept: ~30 g carbs (granola, syrup) and ~8–10 g protein (yogurt), plus calcium and probiotics. It’s about keeping energy up and preventing excessive breakdown late in the day. Elites often have multiple snacks to meet high caloric needs; recreational athletes might choose one substantial snack or two smaller ones depending on hunger.

- **Dinner:** **Pasta with meat sauce + salad** – A big serving of spaghetti or penne (2–3 cups cooked) topped with a lean ground turkey marinara sauce (or plant-based crumbles for vegetarians). Serve with a side salad (mixed greens, tomatoes, peppers, olives) with olive oil and vinegar dressing, and a garlic breadstick or two. Possibly add a glass of milk or fortified plant milk.  
  *Why:* Pasta is a classic runner’s dinner for good reason: a large portion can provide 100–150 g of carbs to replenish glycogen at day’s end. The tomato-based meat sauce contributes ~25–30 g protein (and iron, zinc from the meat, lycopene from tomatoes). The salad adds fiber, vitamin C, vitamin K, etc., and olive oil gives healthy fat (also aiding absorption of fat-soluble vitamins). The breadstick adds extra carbs and salt. This meal helps you recover from the day’s training and stocks carbs for tomorrow. Elites might eat very large pasta portions or even have seconds; recreational might stick to a plateful. It’s important that after a hard training day, both get enough carbs and protein at dinner to promote recovery overnight. If lactose tolerant, milk adds extra protein and fluids; if not, water or an electrolyte drink can accompany to rehydrate.

- **Evening Snack (optional):** **Chocolate milk or cottage cheese with fruit** – If hungry before bed or if training load is high, a small snack like a glass of chocolate milk (8–12 oz) or a bowl of cottage cheese (1/2 cup 2% cottage cheese with pineapple chunks) can be eaten.  
  *Why:* Chocolate milk provides about 25–30 g carbs and 8 g protein in 8 oz (hitting the 3:1 carb:protein sweet spot), plus fluids and electrolytes, which is great if a late workout was done or if you’re still rehydrating. Cottage cheese is rich in casein protein (~14 g per 1/2 cup) which digests slowly overnight, aiding muscle repair, and pineapple adds carbs and the enzyme bromelain which may help soreness. This kind of snack ensures you won’t wake up starving and gives muscles nutrients while you sleep. Many elites have a pre-bed protein feeding (Greek yogurt, protein shake, etc.) for recovery – recreational runners might do this after very hard days or if they struggle to meet protein needs.

This day would cover a marathoner’s needs well: high in carbohydrates (oatmeal, fruits, wrap, sweet potato, pasta, bread, milk, etc.), ample protein spread out (yogurt, chicken, nuts, meat sauce, dairy), moderate healthy fats (nuts, olive oil, peanut butter, avocado if added to wrap or salad, etc.), and loads of micronutrients from fruits and veggies (bananas for potassium, sweet potato for A/C, salad for K/C, berries and citrus for C, almonds for E/Mg, etc.). It also includes salty foods (pretzels, bread, sauce) to provide sodium for recovery and next-day hydration.

**Adjusting for Training and Body Size:** An elite high-mileage runner might need to double some portions: e.g. larger oatmeal serving, two sandwiches or a bigger burrito, more frequent snacking, and definitely larger dinner portions (some elites have dessert too, like Greek yogurt with honey or cereal before bed, to add carbs). A smaller recreational runner might trim portions slightly (maybe 2 cups pasta instead of 3, one breadstick not two) or skip the evening snack if not needed. But the composition can remain similar.

**Incorporating Supplements Naturally:** This day naturally included a lot of key micronutrients, but one could easily include supplements:
- Take an iron supplement with OJ mid-morning if ferritin is low.
- Pop a beta-alanine capsule with breakfast and dinner during loading phase.
- Drink a beet juice shot before an afternoon workout as a test run.
- Use protein powder in the smoothie if needed to reach protein targets.
- Take caffeine (coffee or tea) with breakfast if a morning run or as an afternoon pick-me-up before a second run.

However, focusing on **food first** ensures a strong nutritional foundation. Chocolate milk, for instance, serves as a “natural supplement” for recovery with its 4:1 carb:protein ratio (often cited in sports nutrition research as an effective recovery drink). Similarly, a banana can serve the role of a sports chew (providing quick carbs and potassium).

### Pre-Race Meal (Marathon Morning)  
The pre-race meal should be **high in carbohydrates, low in fiber and fat**, with a moderate amount of protein. It’s eaten ~2–3 hours before the start (time it such that you have finished heavy eating at least 1–2 hours out, to allow digestion). Critically, it must be foods that you have tolerance and confidence in from training. Here are a few proven options:

- **Bagel + Peanut Butter + Banana + Sports Drink:** One plain bagel (or two smaller bagels) provides ~50–60 g of easily digested carbs. Top it thinly with 1–2 tablespoons of peanut butter (for flavor and a bit of protein, but not too much fat) and slices of a banana (~30 g carbs, plus potassium). Drink ~8–12 oz of a sports drink (or water) alongside for additional ~15–20 g carbs and to ensure hydration.  
  *Why:* This combo is a runner’s staple. The bagel is low fiber (especially if using refined flour bagels) and high carb; peanut butter in small amount adds ~8 g protein and some fat to stave off hunger without overloading the stomach; banana is gentle on the stomach and adds extra carbs and potassium. Sports drink adds fluids, sodium, and carbs, helping top off both glycogen and hydration levels. This meal might pack ~80–100 g carbs total (bagel + banana + drink) which for a 60–70 kg runner is about 1.3–1.5 g/kg – enough if eaten 2 hours out. Many elites have used variations of this (e.g. toast with PB and banana). If peanut butter is heavy for you, replace with a light spread of jam and a little butter for taste, or have the banana separately. The key is mostly carbs, a little protein, low fiber.

- **Oatmeal + Honey + Whey Protein:** 1 to 1.5 cups of cooked instant oatmeal (made with water) with a tablespoon of honey or brown sugar stirred in (~50–60 g carbs total) and maybe a small scoop (~10 g) of whey protein isolate mixed in or a hard-boiled egg on the side (to provide ~6–10 g protein). Have a glass of sports drink or a small coffee with sugar (~15–20 g additional carbs).  
  *Why:* Instant oats are fairly quick to digest (less fiber than steel-cut), especially in a moderate portion. Honey adds quick sugars. A little protein from whey or an egg can stabilize blood sugar and provide amino acids, but keeping it around 5–10 g ensures it won’t cause slow digestion or GI issues. This meal is like a scaled-down breakfast oatmeal. Many find warm oatmeal soothing and easy on race nerves. Ensure the portion isn’t huge (high volume can be an issue pre-run). Drinking some sports drink helps with fluid and more carbs. Some elite runners might do oatmeal with a sliced banana and skip the protein to maximize carbs (which is also fine). Others do add protein; for example, 2018 Boston winner Des Linden reportedly had oatmeal with peanut butter and banana on race morning – which covers carbs, some fat, and some protein. Tailor it to your gut – if fiber bothers you, opt for cream of wheat or rice porridge instead of oats.

- **Pancakes or White Bread + Syrup/Jam:** Two to three plain pancakes (from refined flour) with maple syrup (~3 tbsp) or two slices of white toast with jam can supply ~70–90 g of very easily digestible carbs. Add a small side of scrambled egg whites (2–3 egg whites = ~9 g protein, negligible fat) or a low-fat yogurt (~5–8 g protein) for a bit of protein. Drink water or a sports drink as needed (aim for ~8–12 oz fluid here).  
  *Why:* Pancakes and white bread are low in fiber and high in simple carbs, which means quick digestion and glycogen topping. Syrup or jam adds pure glucose/fructose. This is essentially pure carb loading pre-run. The small portion of egg whites or yogurt gives some protein without fat (avoid whole eggs or cheese because fat can upset the stomach pre-race). This is a good option if you prefer a sweet, breakfast-y meal that’s not too heavy. Some runners have used jam sandwiches (the classic being a white bread with honey sandwich, which many elites have eaten pre-race) – that’s essentially the same as this (bread + jam), and you can nibble it easily even if anxious. 

- **Rice Porridge with Soy Sauce Egg:** This is more common in East Asian contexts but effective nonetheless – a bowl (~1.5 cups) of congee (rice porridge, basically overcooked rice in water) which is very low fiber, with a boiled egg or a bit of soy sauce for flavor. Add a sports drink or some fruit juice to get some simple sugars (~20 g carb from a cup of juice).  
  *Why:* White rice is one of the gentlest carb sources – quickly digested and unlikely to cause GI trouble. Congee is rice cooked in extra water, making it easy to slurp if you have no appetite. A little soy sauce provides sodium (like a broth) and an egg gives a touch of protein. This is a savory alternative for those who can’t handle sweets in the morning. Many Japanese marathoners eat rice balls or rice porridge pre-race for this reason. It's also gluten-free for those who need it. Just ensure you also get some quick sugar (hence the juice or a sports drink), since plain rice is fine but a bit of fructose/glucose mix might maximize absorption and liver glycogen re-saturation after the overnight fast.

**Hydration in Pre-Race Meal:** With any of these meals, aim to drink ~500 mL (17 oz) fluid in the 2 hours before the race. This could be water, sports drink, or part of your meal (coffee/tea counts toward fluid, though they can increase urine output slightly). Often recommended is to drink ~5–7 ml/kg about 2–4 hours pre-event (so ~350–500 mL for a 70 kg person), and then another ~200–250 mL (~1 cup) 1 hour out if needed. Be careful not to chug too much right before the gun to avoid pit stops. Finish hydrating ~45–60 min before the start so you can use the restroom. Some runners take a last few sips (~100 mL) right at the start with a gel or just to wet the mouth.

**Examples from Pros (for context):** Many elites eat surprisingly ordinary things: Shalane Flanagan often had a bagel with almond butter and jelly plus a banana pre-marathon. Meb Keflezighi has mentioned oatmeal, toast, and eggs. Yuki Kawauchi (2018 Boston winner) eats ramen noodles (a saltier approach). These mirror the principles: mostly carbs, a little protein, minimal fiber/fat, and well-practiced. Recreational runners should do likewise and not try exotic foods or supplements on race morning that they haven’t tested.

**Timing:** If your race is at 7 AM and you can manage to wake at 4 AM to eat, great (especially if you want a bigger meal). But if sleep is precious, even eating at 5 AM (2 hours prior) is okay – just keep the meal a bit lighter. In the final hour, you can sip on a sports drink or water. Some runners like to take a gel ~15 minutes before the start (with a few sips of water) to top off blood glucose – this is especially useful if your breakfast was 3+ hours before. Research shows a pre-start gel can improve performance, essentially bridging the gap until you start fueling during the race. If you do this, account that gel (20–25 g carb) as part of your overall race fueling plan.

**Final Pre-Race No-Nos:** Avoid high fiber cereals or huge salads the night before that are still in your gut in the morning. Don’t take big doses of branched-chain amino acids or protein shakes in the morning – protein is satiating but too much can cause GI strain. Don’t try weird energy supplements (some might take baking soda, but that’s more for shorter events and can cause diarrhea if done wrong – not advisable for a marathon morning). And certainly avoid rich, greasy foods (bacon, pastries, fried stuff) that can linger in the stomach. 

### During-Race Fueling  
During a marathon, **carbohydrate and fluid intake is paramount**. The practical tools are sports drinks, gels, chews, and possibly small snacks. The goal is to ingest ~30–60 g carbs per hour (up to ~90 g if tolerable), along with fluid to maintain hydration (but avoid overdrinking). Here are concrete fueling strategies:

- **Sports Drink at Aid Stations:** If the race offers a formula like Gatorade Endurance (common at majors), use it. For example, drink ~4 oz (half a cup) at every aid station. Aid stations are often every 2 miles (~3 km). If you are running ~9 min/mile, that’s one station ~ every 18 minutes. Half a cup every station would be ~4 oz every 18 min, which is ~13 oz (~400 mL) per hour, giving ~20 g carb/hour and ~450 mg sodium/hour (since Gatorade Endurance has ~19 g carb and 300 mg Na per 8 oz). Many recreational runners might manage a bit more – maybe a full cup (8 oz) every other station (~every 4 miles). The key is to regularly ingest these small doses so you accumulate carbs and fluid. Sports drinks have the advantage of not needing chewing and providing electrolytes. If it’s a hot day, lean more on the drink for fluids; if cool, you can take smaller sips. *Elite approach:* they often have bottles every 5K with custom mixes to hit ~60–70 g carb/hour, but since recreational runners rely on stations, consistency and early intake is your friend.

- **Energy Gels:** These are concentrated carb sources (typically ~20–25 g carbs each, some up to 30). A common approach: **take one gel every 30–45 minutes** of running, starting at ~30 minutes or 5K into the race. For instance: 5K, 15K, 25K, 35K marks (for a 4-hour runner, that’s roughly 0:30, 1:30, 2:30, 3:30 into the race). With 4 gels, you’d ingest ~80–100 g carbs total. Wash each down with a cup of water to aid absorption and dilute in the stomach (don’t take gels with sports drink, as that can concentrate too much sugar at once; take them with plain water, and drink the sports drink at other stations). If you use caffeinated gels, you might save one for late in the race for a mental boost. For example, take normal gels at 5K, 15K, 25K, and a caffeine gel at 35K. Or if you have two caffeine gels, maybe one at mid-race and one at 35K. *Elite approach:* They often tape gels to bottles or mix gels into their drink. As a recreational runner, you might carry a few gels in a belt or taped to your waistband for easy access. Some races hand out gels at certain points (check race info), but don’t rely on that solely – the flavor/type might not agree with you if untested.

- **Energy Chews/Bloks:** These perform like gels but in chewable form (e.g. Clif Shot Bloks, GU Chomps). A typical pack might be 6–10 pieces totaling ~30–45 g carbs per pack. You can eat 1–2 blocks every mile or two. For example, have one blok (~4 g carb) every mile from miles 5 to 13 (8 miles x 4 g = ~32 g) then switch to gels after, etc. Chews are nice if you prefer smaller continuous intake rather than slugging a whole gel. They also tend to have some electrolytes. Downside is having to chew while running and remembering to eat them regularly. Some people alternate: gel at one hour, chews at the next, etc., for variety. If you go with chews, make sure to also drink water as needed because the act of chewing can dry your mouth and you need fluid to process the carbs.

- **Whole Food Bits (optional):** For most, gels and drinks suffice. But a small number of runners like bits of real food: e.g. half a banana at an aid station (some races hand these out at later stations) or a few gummy bears or pretzels from spectators. If your stomach likes bananas, getting half at mile 20 could provide ~15 g natural carbs and some potassium. Some take a fun-sized candy bar or a packet of honey. These are all okay if they’ve been practiced and as long as they don’t add too much fiber or fat. In general, **avoid fiber, fat, and protein during the race** (so no energy bars with nuts or heavy protein – they slow digestion). Stick to quick carbs and small portions if it’s solid. The marathon is not the time to eat a PB&J; but a couple of orange slices can be refreshing and give sugar and water. If you do take any solid, chase it with water to help it go down.

- **Electrolyte intake mid-race:** If you are a heavy sweater or the race is hot, consider a salt capsule at halfway (and another at 30K if needed). E.g. take one capsule (~200–300 mg sodium) with water around the 1:45–2:00 mark. Or simply rely on sports drinks. If you notice salt crusts on your skin or kit mid-race and feel crampy, definitely don’t skip the sports drink at the next station. Some runners carry a small vial of salt solution or electrolyte concentrate to squirt into the water cups – that’s advanced, but doable. Usually, consistent sports drink intake plus the sodium in gels (typically 50–100 mg each) suffices for most. 

- **Cramp Management:** If you start cramping, sometimes an quick intake of something like pickle juice (if provided or if you carry a small 1 oz shot) can neurochemically help override cramping (this is a trick used in ultras – a 1 oz pickle juice shot often relieves cramps within a minute due to activating certain receptors in the mouth/throat). It’s intense but effective for some. It’s not so much nutrition as a neuromuscular hack. Use only if cramping is an issue – hopefully with proper training and electrolyte fueling, you won’t cramp severely.

**Putting it all together (Example Routine for a 4-hour marathoner):**  
- *Pre-start (15 min before gun):* One energy gel (maybe 20 mg caffeine) + 4 oz water. This ensures a last dose of carbs right as you start (and it counts toward your hourly total).  
- *During miles 1–5:* Focus on settling in. At first aid (mile ~2), take a couple sips of sports drink (2–3 oz). At next aid (mile ~4), do the same or drink water if you plan a gel soon.  
- *45 min (around 5 miles):* Take Gel #1 (if you did one at start, this could be Gel #2 – adjust accordingly). Wash it down with at least half a cup of water at the next station.  
- *1:15 (around 9 miles):* Take a few energy chews (or if not using chews, you might wait till 1:30 for next gel). Keep grabbing sports drink at stations in between – aim by now to have consumed e.g. ~12 oz sports drink (~25 g carbs) and one gel (~25 g), totaling ~50 g in the first 1.25 hrs. That’s a bit under 40 g/h – you can bump it up slightly going forward.  
- *1:30 (around 10 miles/16 km):* Gel #2, with water. If you use caffeine gels and want it mid-race, this is a spot (some do at half). Ensure you take some sodium via sports drink too especially if sweating a lot.  
- *2:00 (halfway ~13.1 miles):* If you have salt caps and feel very sweaty, consider one now (with water, not with a gel at same time – space them a few minutes apart). Continue to drink at least 4–6 oz each station; perhaps alternate between water and sports drink depending on what you need (water when taking gels, sports drink when not).  
- *2:15 (15 miles):* Gel #3 (or if you’re doing 4 total, you might do one at 2:15 and another at 3:00). Wash with water.  
- *2:45 (18–19 miles):* The wall territory. At 18-20 miles many start struggling. Get carbs in just before this point. If you have chews left, eat a couple for steady intake. And definitely grab sports drink at stations – even if you have to slow down a tad to get it down, the investment repays. Some runners like a caffeinated gel here (~35K) to perk them up for the final push. If that’s you, Gel #4 at ~3:00 (20 miles) with caffeine could be timed so it kicks in by 22-23 miles.  
- *3:00 (20 miles/32 km):* Gel #4 (ideally caffeinated for a boost). Wash with water. Psychologically, you know this is your last gel – muster through and chase it with sips of sports drink at the next aid to maximize absorption (the mix of multiple carb sources helps, and the sodium aids uptake).  
- *3:30 (23–24 miles):* At this point, stomach might not want anything, but try to at least sip sports drink or suck on an energy chew for a bit of sugar. Rinse your mouth with the sports drink even if swallowing is hard – carb rinse has been shown to trick the brain into feeling less fatigued ([
            Nutrition and Supplement Update for the Endurance Athlete: Review and Recommendations - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6628334/#:~:text=theory%20%5B13%5D%2C%20a%20CNS,term%20%281%20h%29%20exercise)). Many runners can’t handle another gel here, but if you have one and feel you need it, nothing wrong with taking it even at 24–25 miles. Otherwise, trust the fuel you’ve taken and focus on reaching the finish. Some also take a caffeine gum now (since caffeine can work quickly through oral absorption). Up to personal preference.  
- *Finish (~4:00):* You likely consumed in total: ~4 gels (~100 g), ~20 oz sports drink (~40+ g), chews (~20 g) = ~160 g carbs, plus maybe ~1.5–2 L fluid. That’s about 40 g/hour average, which should significantly help performance vs. minimal fueling. If you managed closer to 50–60 g/h (e.g. more drink or an extra gel), even better for performance, as studies suggest **higher carb intake (up to ~60–90 g/h) correlates with better marathon times** in recreational runners because it delays hitting the wall.

For faster runners (3 hr marathon), the schedule compresses: maybe gel every 40 min. For slower (5 hr), maybe every 45–60 min but keep drinking and maybe add a 5th gel if needed to maintain intake.

**Golden Rule:** **Never try something new on race day**. If you haven’t used a certain gel brand, don’t take it from the station (they often provide one brand/flavor – try it in training first, or carry your own). Same goes for sports drink: train with what the race will provide if possible. Most races advertise their fuel (e.g. “Gatorade Endurance Lemon-Lime at stations”); buy some and use it on long runs so your gut is used to it.

Finally, **listen to your body** during the race: if you feel sloshy, back off fluids a bit; if you feel unusually weak or lightheaded, up the carbs (maybe take the gel 10 min earlier than planned). It’s a dynamic process. But having a general fueling plan as above provides structure so you don’t forget to fuel until it’s too late.

### Post-Race Recovery Nutrition  
After finishing a marathon, focus on the 3 R’s of recovery: **Refuel (carbs), Rebuild (protein), Rehydrate (fluids & electrolytes)**. The body is glycogen-depleted, likely somewhat dehydrated, and muscle fibers are damaged – prompt nutrition accelerates recovery significantly. 

**0–30 Minutes Post-Finish:** This is when you might not feel hungry, but you should try to get something down.
- **Fluids:** Immediately grab a drink. Ideal choices: **Chocolate milk** (often provided, containing ~30 g carbs, 8 g protein per 8 oz) or a **sports recovery drink** (some races give Gatorade Recover or similar, ~20 g protein, 40 g carbs). If those aren’t available, even regular sports drink plus a protein bar will do. **Water alone is not ideal** now – you want carbs and sodium too. If nothing else, drink the sports drink and eat a banana (carbs + potassium) from the finish line food.
- **Carbs + Protein Snack:** Aim for ~1 g/kg carbs and ~0.25 g/kg protein within the first hour. For a 70 kg runner, that’s ~70 g carbs, ~17 g protein. Examples: 
  - 20 oz Gatorade (≈34 g carb) + a pack of peanut butter crackers (≈25 g carb, 4 g protein) + a small bag of pretzels (≈20 g carb, 2 g protein, lots of salt) = ~79 g carb, 6 g protein – not quite enough protein, so maybe add a little protein from somewhere (like a piece of jerky or yogurt if available). 
  - 12 oz chocolate milk (≈40 g carb, 12 g pro) + a banana (27 g carb, 1 g pro) + a handful of trail mix (10 g carb, 3 g pro) = ~77 g carb, 16 g pro – solid recovery start. 
  - A recovery shake you packed: 2 scoops recovery powder (e.g. with 50 g carb, 20 g whey protein) mixed in water – easy to chug, covers both macros.
- **Electrolytes:** Have something salty. Many races offer **broth** or pretzels or chips in the finish area. If your stomach can handle it, nibble pretzels or sip broth – the sodium will help with rehydration. If not, an electrolyte drink like Pedialyte or even a salt tablet with water can help if you suspect hyponatremia (dizzy, headache, very low salt). Most will be fine just eating normal foods though – the body craves salt naturally.
- **Cooling Down:** While this is not exactly nutrition, note that gentle movement (walking around the finish area, stretching lightly) and staying warm (to avoid getting the chills as adrenaline drops) can make it easier to stomach food. Sitting immediately can sometimes worsen dizziness. So keep moving a bit, get that recovery drink in, then proceed to changing clothes and getting a proper meal.

**30 min–2 Hours Post-Finish (Next Meal):** Once you’ve left the finish area and settled a bit, aim to eat a real meal relatively soon. Marathon finish lines often have food like bagels, fruit, cookies – take some with you, you might feel like eating 30–60 min later. 

Within 2 hours, plan a **substantial meal**:
- **High-Carb, Moderate-Protein Meal:** Good options include: **Burrito bowl** with rice, beans, chicken, cheese, salsa, guac (carbs from rice & beans ~80+ g, protein from chicken & beans ~30 g, salt and good fats from other stuff). **Pizza** with a lean protein topping (e.g. chicken or just cheese and veg): 3 slices thin crust can be ~90 g carbs, 30 g protein, plenty of salt – and easy to eat. **Pasta** with meat sauce works as well for dinner later, but within 2 hours you might not have that ready.
- **Post-Race Party Food:** Often after cleaning up, runners celebrate with whatever they crave – beer, burgers, fries, etc. It’s fine to treat yourself, just remember your muscles need nutrients. If you want a burger, maybe opt for a grilled chicken sandwich or add an extra bun for carbs, and definitely get some salty fries or a baked potato. If having a beer, maybe do half a beer and also a sports drink or water (as alcohol can delay rehydration – one beer won’t hurt much, but moderation is key as larger amounts of alcohol can impede muscle recovery and glycogen replenishment). A common recommendation is hold off on heavy drinking until rehydration and an initial recovery meal is done, because you’ll handle it better and it won’t interfere as much with recovery processes. Some races give free beer at finish – one light beer (with some carbs, ~13 g, albeit the alcohol is not helpful) is okay, but chase it with water and keep eating carbs.

- **Micronutrients & Anti-Inflammatories:** In the day after, include fruits (e.g. berries, oranges) and veggies or anti-inflammatory foods (turmeric, tart cherry juice, omega-3 rich fish) to help with inflammation and immune stress. Tart cherry juice in particular has been shown to reduce post-marathon inflammation and muscle soreness when consumed before and after the race (some runners do 8 oz cherry juice twice a day for 5 days around the race). It’s not essential but could speed how you feel. Even a couple of servings of blueberries or a fruit smoothie with mixed berries can contribute antioxidants to help muscle repair.

- **Rehydrate Aggressively:** Monitor your urine color – it will likely be quite dark after the race. You’ll need to drink enough fluids over the next 12–24 hours to get back to pale yellow. Aim to drink ~1.2–1.5 liters of fluid for each kilogram of body weight lost during the race. If you don’t know, just drink consistently (water, sports drinks, recovery drinks, milk) and include salty snacks so you retain it. A good approach is to sip on a big sports drink in the hour after, water in between, maybe have soup for dinner (soup is excellent – fluid + salt + some carbs), and keep a water bottle handy. Signs you’re rehydrated: you’re urinating every few hours and it’s light in color; you no longer feel a big thirst or dry mouth. Also, weighing yourself the next day vs pre-race – you should be back to baseline.

- **Don’t Neglect Protein:** While carbs are often craved, protein is needed to repair all the muscle damage (marathons cause micro-tears in muscle fibers, requiring amino acids for repair). So in that post-race day, make sure each meal has a good protein source (meat, fish, eggs, dairy, or plant proteins). Aim to get at least 20–30 g protein in both lunch and dinner post-race. For example, have Greek yogurt or a protein shake if you can’t get enough at the meals. The day after a marathon, continuing higher protein intake (like 1.5 g/kg/day) will aid the healing process. Marathoners often have suppressed appetite for a short while after the race but then get very hungry later or the next day – so be ready with healthy options.

**Example Recovery Timeline:**  
- *Finish + 10 min:* Drink 500 mL sports drink. Eat a banana.  
- *Finish + 30 min:* Change into dry clothes. Sip chocolate milk (about 300 mL).  
- *Finish + 1 hour:* Meet family; nibble a granola bar (~25 g carb, 5 g protein). Start on second bottle of sports drink or water + electrolyte tablet.  
- *Finish + 2 hours:* At lunch spot, eat a large turkey sub with veggies and cheese (lots of bread = carbs, turkey = protein, pickles = salt). Drink a soda or sports drink for more carbs.  
- *Finish + 3–4 hours:* Nap or rest. (Keep water by bed; drink on waking if thirsty.)  
- *Finish + 6 hours:* Snack on pretzels and hummus or have a smoothie (fruit + yogurt) if hungry. If not, it’s okay – appetite may return later. Keep hydrating (maybe alternate water and coconut water or a recovery electrolyte drink).  
- *Finish + 8 hours (dinner):* Enjoy that celebratory meal but incorporate recovery: e.g. steak (protein, iron), sweet potato (carbs), salad. Or a personal pizza loaded with chicken and veggies. And a beer or two if desired (just ensure you also have water).  
- *Finish + 12 hours (bedtime):* Have a casein-rich snack like a cup of milk or some cottage cheese to keep amino acid availability during sleep. Stretch gently, take an Epsom salt bath if that’s your thing (magnesium absorption might help muscle relaxation). Sleep – this is when a lot of recovery happens!

**The Next Day:** Continue eating well – plenty of carbs to restore muscles (especially if you plan to run again within a few days, though many take a rest week), and protein to rebuild. Some runners lose their sweet tooth after a big race and crave savory foods – that’s fine, as long as you get carbs from starches and fruits, and enough salt and protein. Keep hydrating; maybe use an electrolyte packet in water to ensure you’re fully rehydrated. Pay attention to any signs of lingering dehydration (headache, low urine output). 

In summary, recovery nutrition is just as important as pre-race fueling. A well-fed, well-hydrated body will repair itself faster, meaning less soreness, a stronger immune system (hard endurance effort can temporarily depress immunity, so nutrients like vitamin C, protein, and zinc help keep you from catching a cold after the race), and a better bounce-back to normal training. As a practical tip: plan what you’ll eat after the race *before* you run (have something in your gear bag or know a restaurant) because decision-making when you’re exhausted is tough. Use the guidelines: **carb + protein + salt + fluid**. If a specific craving hits (ice cream, fries, etc.), incorporate it with those guidelines (e.g. maybe have that ice cream for carbs and treat, but also have a protein bar or a piece of chicken breast alongside – why not? 😄).

## Summary of Key Findings and Recommendations  

**Summary:** Marathoning demands a **high-carbohydrate diet** to fuel long runs and race pace, with adequate **protein** for muscle recovery and moderate **healthy fats** for overall health. Strategic timing of nutrient intake – particularly **carb-loading** before the race and **carb+electrolyte fueling during** – can significantly improve performance and delay fatigue. **Micronutrients** like iron and magnesium must be maintained at sufficient levels to support endurance (iron for oxygen delivery, magnesium for energy metabolism and muscle function). Evidence-based **supplements** can provide small but meaningful benefits: caffeine reliably enhances endurance, nitrate (beetroot) improves efficiency, and others like beta-alanine and creatine can be useful in certain contexts. Both **elite and recreational runners** generally follow the same core principles, though elites often push intakes closer to recommended ceilings (e.g. higher carb grams per kg, fine-tuned fluid plans) whereas recreational runners should adapt guidelines to their individual tolerance and needs. Below are the key practical recommendations:

**1. Emphasize Carbohydrates:** Marathoners need a high-carb diet daily to fuel training and recovery. Aim for **6–10 g/kg/day of carbs** on training days (e.g. ~420–700 g for a 70 kg runner). Include carb-rich foods at each meal: pasta, rice, bread, potatoes, oats, fruits, starchy vegetables. During heavy training or pre-race, increase this toward ~8–12 g/kg (especially in the 1–2 days of carbo-loading). Before long runs or races, **carbo-load** by tapering exercise and eating very high-carb (e.g. 70%+ of calories) for 1–3 days – this maximizes muscle glycogen and can improve performance by# Optimal Nutrition Strategies for Marathon Running

## Introduction  
Marathon running places extreme demands on the body’s energy systems and recovery processes. Optimal nutrition is crucial to fuel training, enhance performance on race day, and aid recovery. Both **elite and recreational marathoners** benefit from evidence-based dietary strategies, though elites often fine-tune these to a greater degree (e.g. higher absolute intakes and personalized plans) while recreational runners may need to adapt guidelines to their tolerance and lifestyle. In general, **carbohydrates** are the primary fuel for endurance running, **protein** supports muscle repair and recovery, and **fat** provides essential nutrients and a secondary energy source. Adequate **micronutrients** (vitamins and minerals) are needed for performance and health, and certain **supplements** have proven ergogenic benefits in endurance sports. Below, we break down optimal marathon nutrition by macronutrients, micronutrients, and evidence-backed supplements, and provide practical food examples for training and race day. We note where recommendations differ (or not) between elites and recreational runners. A summary of key takeaways and practical tips is provided at the end.

## 1. Macronutrients for Marathon Training and Racing  

**Marathoners must balance the “big three” macros – carbs, protein, fats – to meet the high energy demands of training and racing.** The ideal mix shifts slightly between daily training and race-specific prep, but all three are important:

### 1.1 Carbohydrates: The Marathoner’s Primary Fuel  
- **Role:** Carbohydrates (CHO) are the dominant fuel source for marathon running. They provide glucose to fill muscle and liver glycogen stores, which are the critical energy reservoirs for long-duration exercise. High-carb availability allows you to maintain pace longer and delays fatigue (“hitting the wall”). When glycogen depletes, performance drops dramatically, so keeping stores topped up is essential.  
- **Daily Intake:** Endurance experts (ACSM, IOC) recommend a **high-carb diet** for marathoners. Targets range from **5–7 grams per kg body weight per day** for moderate training (~1 hour/day) up to **6–10 g/kg/day** for 1–3 hours/day of intense training. In peak training (very high mileage or doubles), athletes may need **8–12 g/kg/day**. For example, a 60 kg recreational runner might aim for ~360 g/day on moderate days and 420–480+ g on long run days; a 70 kg elite might regularly consume 500–700 g/day. In practice, this means **making carbs the centerpiece of every meal** – e.g. breakfast could be oatmeal and fruit (mostly carbs), lunch a sandwich or rice bowl, snacks granola bars or smoothies, dinner pasta or potatoes. Approximately **60–70% of total calories from carbs** is a common guideline for runners.  
- **Training Considerations:** Carbs should be emphasized **before, during, and after workouts**. Before long or hard runs, consume a carb-rich meal (e.g. toast with jam, banana, sports drink) to ensure high glycogen and blood glucose. During long runs (>90 min), practice fueling with ~30–60 g/hr of carbs (gels, sports drink – see “During Race” below) to train your gut and sustain energy. After workouts, ingest carbs promptly to replenish glycogen, especially if another session is coming up soon. For example, aim for ~1.0–1.2 g/kg of carbs in the first hour post-exercise (e.g. ~70 g for a 60 kg runner) – recovery foods like chocolate milk, fruit smoothies, or a bagel with honey work well. This high-carb focus helps you “train hard and recover fast” by restoring fuel between sessions.  
- **Pre-Race Carb Loading:** Topping off glycogen stores before a marathon is crucial. Most marathoners should perform **carbohydrate loading** in the 1–3 days prior to the race. This involves tapering training volume and consuming **~8–12 g/kg of carbs per day** for ~36–48 hours pre-race. For a 70 kg runner, that’s ~560–840 g of carbs per day (on the higher end for elites, lower end sufficient for shorter/lighter runners). Such intake significantly boosts muscle glycogen (studies show ~2–3% performance improvements from carb-loading). Practically, this means basing meals almost entirely on starches and sugars: e.g. *breakfast:* pancakes with syrup and fruit juice; *lunch:* big bowl of pasta with marinara, pretzels on the side; *snack:* sports drink and a banana; *dinner:* rice, lean protein, and a low-fiber dessert like sorbet. **Elites** typically execute carb-loading meticulously (often ~10–12 g/kg/day) because it allows them to sustain goal pace longer. **Recreational runners** also benefit – even if ~8–10 g/kg/day is all one can manage, that’s usually enough when combined with a proper taper. The key is to **avoid excess fiber and fat** during this period (to prevent GI issues) and focus on *glycogen-dense* foods (white rice, white bread, pasta, potatoes, bananas, oatmeal, sports drinks, low-fiber cereals).  
- **During Race Fuel:** During the marathon itself, consuming carbs is vital to delay glycogen depletion. Guidelines call for **30–60+ g of carbohydrate per hour** of racing. This could be via sports drinks, gels, chews, or other easily-digested carb sources. (Details on specific race fueling strategies are in section 4.) Many elites target the high end (~60–80+ g/hr) by grabbing their personal bottles frequently, while recreational runners should aim for at least ~30 g/hr (e.g. a gel every 45 min) and up to ~60 g/hr if they can tolerate it. Proper carb intake during the race can significantly improve finish times and reduce the severity of “the wall”.  
- **“Train Low” Caution:** Some recent theories suggest occasionally training with low glycogen (to stimulate fat adaptation). While there’s nuance here, **do not habitually train or race on a low-carb diet** – research shows it *does not* improve marathon performance and can impair high-intensity capacity. At most, advanced athletes might do a few easy morning runs before breakfast (to enhance fat use), but for quality workouts and races, high-carb availability is crucial. As one review concluded: *“there is no evidence that a low carbohydrate diet enhances training outcomes for marathoners”*. Thus, the prevailing wisdom is “**train hard on carbs, and race high on carbs**,” using fat adaptation only sparingly if at all.  
- **Takeaway:** **Prioritize carbohydrates**. Make them the foundation of your marathon nutrition plan – from daily meals (grains, fruits, starches) to pre-race loading and in-race fueling. This applies to elites (who fine-tune grams per kg) and recreational runners alike (who should simply ensure each meal has a large carb source). When in doubt, add another spoon of rice or an extra banana! Carbs are the marathoner’s best friend for both training and race day.

### 1.2 Protein: Repair and Recovery  
- **Role:** Protein provides amino acids to repair muscle damage from training, supports training adaptations (like building mitochondrial enzymes), and helps maintain lean mass during heavy training. While running isn’t a muscle-building sport, marathoners still experience muscle fiber micro-tears (especially from long runs or downhill running) and can enter catabolic states if protein is inadequate. Protein also plays a role in supporting immune function – important because hard training can stress the immune system.  
- **Daily Intake:** Endurance athletes benefit from higher protein intake than sedentary folks. **1.2–1.6 g of protein per kg body weight per day** is a general recommendation (with up to ~2.0 g/kg at times of very intense training or caloric deficit). For example, a 60 kg runner should target ~72–96 g protein/day; a 70 kg runner ~84–112 g/day. This ensures a positive protein balance for muscle repair. In practice, that might look like 20–30 g of protein in each main meal plus protein-rich snacks. Good sources include lean meats, poultry, fish, eggs, dairy (milk, yogurt, cheese), and plant alternatives like beans, lentils, tofu, tempeh, and soy milk. *Elites* often hover around ~1.5 g/kg (some leaning toward the higher end if training very intensely or trying to lose fat while preserving muscle). *Recreational runners* should ensure they hit at least the lower end (~1.2 g/kg), as general diets sometimes fall short (especially if one is dieting or vegetarian without careful planning).  
- **Timing & Distribution:** **Evenly distribute protein intake** across the day for best results. The body can only use so much protein at once for muscle synthesis (~20–30 g); beyond that, it’s oxidized for energy or wasted. Aim for **0.3–0.4 g/kg per meal**, which is ~20–30 g for most runners. For example, 25 g at breakfast (e.g. Greek yogurt + nuts), 30 g at lunch (e.g. chicken breast in a sandwich), 30 g at dinner (fish or tofu with quinoa), and 10–15 g in snacks (a protein bar or glass of milk) might get a 60 kg runner ~95 g over the day. Spreading protein out (every ~3–4 hours) maximizes muscle protein synthesis and supports continuous recovery.  
- **Post-Exercise Protein:** Consuming some protein soon after workouts, especially long runs or hard sessions, helps repair muscle fibers and may reduce muscle soreness. The guideline is ~15–25 g of high-quality protein within the **0–2 hour “window” after exercise**, ideally combined with carbs. For instance, after a 20-mile run, a runner could have chocolate milk (8–10 g protein) plus a turkey sandwich (15–20 g protein) soon after finishing. This “recovery meal” stimulates muscle repair (via amino acids) and refills glycogen (via carbs). Elites often have formulated recovery shakes (e.g. 20 g whey + 60 g carbs) right after key workouts. Recreational runners can use simple foods: yogurt with fruit, protein-fortified smoothies, or even a quick protein bar and sports drink. What matters is getting those building blocks in.  
- **Protein and Satiety:** Protein is filling, which is useful for weight management but can be a double-edged sword for marathoners needing high calories. If a runner is struggling to eat enough carbs because they feel too full, they might temporarily trim protein around key training times to prioritize fuel (since carbs, not protein, directly fuel running). But generally, marathoners burn so many calories they can fit in plenty of both. Just be mindful not to let extremely high protein displace carbs – balance is key. The range above (1.2–1.6 g/kg) is moderate and leaves room for ample carbs.  
- **Differences (Elite vs Recreational):** Both groups need similar relative amounts. **Elites** with high training loads and strength training in their program may push toward 1.6–2.0 g/kg to support recovery and lean mass, especially if they are in an energy deficit to reach race weight. **Recreational runners** often hover around 1.0 g/kg from a normal diet; bumping that to ~1.2–1.4 g/kg can improve recovery noticeably (e.g. fewer niggles and less next-day soreness). Also, recreational athletes are more prone to *under*-eating protein (skipping recovery meals due to post-run busyness, etc.), so some conscious effort to include protein is valuable.  
- **Takeaway:** **Prioritize protein for recovery**. Ensure each meal contains ~20–30 g protein and that you have a protein + carb source soon after long/hard runs. High-quality proteins (rich in all essential amino acids) like dairy, eggs, lean meat, soy, or a mix of plant proteins are ideal. Adequate protein will help you repair muscles faster, reduce injury risk, and maintain strength over months of training. Marathon training is endurance-focused, but strong muscles are what carry you through 26.2 miles, and protein is critical to keep them resilient.

### 1.3 Fats: Essential Nutrients & Secondary Fuel  
- **Role:** Dietary fats are essential for overall health and support endurance training in several ways. They provide essential fatty acids (like omega-3s) for inflammation control, help absorb fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, K), and serve as a concentrated energy source. During lower-intensity and longer-duration exercise, fat oxidation supplies a significant portion of energy – training enhances your ability to use fat as fuel, sparing glycogen. Unlike carbs and protein, there’s no specific “loading” for fats, but an adequate intake is important to maintain hormonal balance (very low-fat diets can disrupt hormones) and to ensure calorie needs are met, especially for high-mileage runners who burn tremendous calories.  
- **Daily Intake:** Marathoners should follow general healthy fat guidelines: roughly **20–35% of total calories from fat**, with an emphasis on **unsaturated fats**. In practice, that often comes out to **~1–1.5 g fat per kg body weight** (though percentage of calories is the better gauge, since absolute grams vary with total calorie intake). For example, on a 3000 kcal/day diet, 25% from fat = ~83 g fat. A 60 kg runner eating ~2700 kcal might have ~75 g fat/day (which is ~1.25 g/kg). This level supports health without displacing carbs. **Do not go below ~0.5–0.8 g/kg** (which would be <15% calories for most) for prolonged periods, as extremely low fat intake can impair recovery, reduce absorption of nutrients, and potentially lower testosterone (in males) or contribute to menstrual issues (in females). Marathoners benefit from “healthy fats” which have anti-inflammatory effects – e.g. *omega-3 fats* from fish, flaxseed, chia, walnuts reduce inflammation and may aid recovery of muscles and tendons.  
- **Sources:** Emphasize **unsaturated fats**: e.g. olive oil, avocados, nuts, nut butters, seeds (chia, flax, pumpkin), and oily fish (salmon, tuna, sardines). These foods provide not just calories but also micronutrients (vitamin E in nuts, omega-3s in fish, etc.) that benefit endurance athletes by knocking down exercise-induced inflammation. Limit trans fats and keep saturated fats moderate (some is fine – e.g. dairy fat can be beneficial in moderation – but the focus should be on unsaturated). 
- **Timing:** Unlike carbs and protein, **fat timing is mostly about avoiding certain times**: specifically, **limit high-fat foods immediately before and during running**. Fat slows digestion and can cause GI distress if consumed too close to workouts or races, and it doesn’t provide quick energy. So the guidance is: **low-fat meals in the ~2–3 hours pre-run/race**, and minimal fat in mid-run fuel. For example, on race morning or before a speed workout, skip the bacon, limit butter, choose low-fat cooking methods (boiled/oven instead of fried). **During the race**, do not consume fatty foods (no nuts, chocolate, etc.) – stick to carbs and electrolytes. Outside of those windows, fat can be included normally. After exercise, a bit of fat in the recovery meal is fine (and can make food taste better and be more satisfying), but don’t prioritize fat over the carbs/protein when immediate recovery is the goal.  
- **“Train Low” and Fat Adaptation:** Some marathoners experiment with training in a carb-depleted state to boost fat-burning capacity (e.g. “fasted long runs”). While this can increase fat utilization, it often compromises training intensity and quality. Also, marathon race pace is usually high enough (~70–80% VO₂max for many) that carbohydrates still dominate energy supply. The consensus is that any fat-adaptation strategies should *not* replace the traditional high-carb approach, but could be sprinkled in if an athlete tolerates them, as part of a periodized nutrition plan. Importantly, **carb availability must be high on race day** (“race high”) even if you occasionally “train low”. A practical moderate approach: do an easy recovery run before breakfast occasionally (enhances fat use) but ensure all quality runs and long runs are well-fueled with carbs. And regardless, maintain a moderate fat intake in diet for health – don’t confuse “training low carb” with “eating no fat.” They are different; the former might mean timing low glycogen for a specific session, the latter would be an unsustainable diet plan for an endurance athlete.  
- **Differences (Elite vs Recreational):** **Elites** often naturally get ~25–30% of calories from fat; they don’t severely restrict it, because they need the calories and the nutrients from fat. They might reduce fat slightly in the final days of carbo-loading (to make more room for carbs) or avoid fat in the pre-race dinner/breakfast to ensure quick digestion. **Recreational runners** sometimes fall into two camps: some eat too much fat (at the expense of carbs – think keto trends or just high intake of fried/fast foods), which can hurt performance; others, in pursuit of low weight, eat too little fat (which can lead to energy deficiency issues). The sweet spot is a balanced approach. Both groups should aim for that ~20–30% range. For example, a daily menu might include avocado on toast in the morning, a handful of nuts as a snack, olive oil on a salad, and a piece of salmon at dinner – collectively providing ample healthy fats and meeting needs without overdoing it.  
- **Practical Tip – Pre-Race:** In the 1–2 days pre-marathon (carb-loading phase), **limit high-fat items** to avoid GI issues and to maximize carb intake. For example, choose tomato sauce over Alfredo, fruit and jam over pastries, grilled chicken (small amount) over a cheeseburger. And on race morning, keep the meal low-fat (e.g. bagel with a thin spread of peanut butter is okay, but skip the bacon and big omelet). This ensures rapid digestion and reduces risk of pit stops. After the race (and during normal training time), return to including fats normally for satiety and recovery.  
- **Takeaway:** **Include healthy fats each day**, but time them wisely. About 1/4 of your calories from fat is a good target. Use fats to add flavor and nutrients – drizzle olive oil on veggies, snack on nuts or peanut butter, eat oily fish weekly. Avoid heavy, greasy meals before runs and during the carbo-load phase. A moderate fat intake supports overall health, reduces inflammation, and keeps you fueled on long efforts (since your body will tap into body fat as you run). In short: **don’t go fat-free** (you need fats!), but **don’t make fat the focus** of your marathon diet either – carbs hold that throne. Balance is key.

## 2. Micronutrients: Small but Mighty for Marathoners  

Micronutrients – vitamins and minerals – often work behind the scenes, but they are vital for marathon performance and recovery. They support energy production (B-vitamins, iron), oxygen transport (iron), bone health (calcium, vitamin D, K), muscle contraction (electrolytes like sodium, potassium, magnesium, calcium), and reducing oxidative stress (antioxidants like vitamins C and E, selenium). Marathon runners need to be especially mindful of certain micronutrients because endurance training can increase their requirements or losses. Below we highlight some key micros and how they impact marathoners, and note any differences between elites and recreational runners:

### 2.1 Iron: Oxygen Transport and Endurance Capacity  
- **Why It Matters:** **Iron** is a critical component of hemoglobin (in red blood cells) and myoglobin (in muscles), which carry oxygen to working muscles. Marathon performance is highly dependent on aerobic metabolism – and without adequate iron, the body can’t deliver enough O₂ to sustain high-intensity running. Iron also aids energy production in cells. Iron deficiency (with or without anemia) impairs VO₂max, causes fatigue, and lengthens recovery. It’s very common in endurance athletes, especially women. Signs include chronic tiredness, poor performance despite training, pale skin, and frequent shortness of breath. Even mild iron deficiency (low ferritin stores) can hurt performance and immune function in runners.  
- **Increased Needs for Runners:** Athletes often have higher iron needs due to:
  - **Foot-strike hemolysis:** repetitive pounding can break red blood cells in feet, releasing iron that may be lost.
  - **Sweat loss:** small amounts of iron are lost in sweat.
  - **GI bleeding:** intense exercise can cause minor GI tract micro-bleeds (especially in long distance) leading to iron loss.
  - **Dietary factors:** Many runners (especially female or vegetarian) might not consume high-iron foods regularly.
  - **Menstruation:** Women lose iron monthly through menstrual blood. Female marathoners are at particular risk of iron depletion, which can contribute to menstrual dysfunction and the Female Athlete Triad/RED-S if not addressed.  
- **Recommendation:** **Aim for a high-iron diet and monitor iron status.** The RDA for iron is 18 mg/day for women 19-50 years (due to menstruation) and 8 mg/day for men and postmenopausal women. Athletes may benefit from intakes slightly above the RDA, especially female athletes (e.g. 18–25 mg for women, 10+ mg for men). Focus on iron-rich foods:
  - *Heme iron* (well-absorbed): lean red meat (beef, bison, lamb), dark poultry, liver, seafood (clams, oysters). Just 3–4 oz of beef can provide ~3 mg iron, and clams are extremely high (~23 mg in 3 oz).
  - *Non-heme iron* (less absorbed, but important): beans, lentils, tofu, spinach, fortified cereals, pumpkin seeds. For example, 1 cup cooked lentils has ~6.6 mg, 1 cup cooked spinach ~6 mg, many breakfast cereals 8–18 mg (check the label for “iron %DV”). 
  - **Enhance absorption:** Pair non-heme iron sources with vitamin C-rich foods ([
            Exploring the Relationship between Micronutrients and Athletic Performance: A Comprehensive Scientific Systematic Review of the Literature in Sports Medicine - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10302780/#:~:text=Iron%20deficiency%2C%20whether%20combined%20with,Dairy%20products%2C%20sardines%20and%20salmon)). Vitamin C converts iron to a more absorbable form. Example: have oranges or strawberries with iron-fortified cereal, add tomatoes or bell peppers (vitamin C) to your spinach salad, drink citrus juice with a bean burrito. Also cook in cast-iron cookware occasionally – it can impart iron to foods.
  - **Avoid inhibitors around high-iron meals:** Calcium supplements, high-dose zinc, coffee, and tea (tannins) can inhibit iron absorption. It’s not critical to avoid them entirely, but try not to consume those at the exact same time as your main iron-rich meal. For instance, have your coffee an hour before breakfast or a couple hours after an iron supplement, rather than with it.
- **Monitoring:** Marathoners should consider getting a **ferritin test** (blood test for iron stores) periodically, especially if feeling unexplained fatigue or if female. A *healthy ferritin* for an athlete is often cited to be >30 ng/mL (some sports med experts prefer >40–50 ng/mL for female endurance athletes). Low ferritin (<15–20) indicates depleted iron stores and warrants action. *Elites* often test 2–3 times per year and proactively increase iron intake or use supplements if levels are trending down. *Recreational runners* can ask their doctor for this test during annual check-ups or if they have symptoms.
- **Supplementation:** If diet alone is not maintaining iron levels (as confirmed by bloodwork), iron supplements may be necessary. **Do not supplement with iron “just because”** – too much iron can be harmful (pro-oxidative and can cause constipation or worse, iron overload in susceptible individuals). But for a confirmed deficiency or low ferritin, a supplement (e.g. ferrous sulfate ~65 mg elemental iron per day, taken with vitamin C) can effectively boost levels. Work with a healthcare provider on dosage and duration. Many athletes take iron during heavy training as a preventive measure, but this should be guided by test results to avoid unnecessary supplementation. Also, supplements can cause GI upset, so take them with food or try different forms (ferrous bisglycinate is gentler for some).
- **Elite vs Recreational:** **Elites** are typically very vigilant about iron – it’s a common limiting factor in performance if not managed. They often have nutritionists ensuring they eat enough high-iron foods (e.g. many top marathoners regularly include lean red meat or take low-dose supplements). Some elite female runners get IV iron infusions if they have severe anemia under medical supervision. **Recreational runners** might not be as aware, and iron deficiency is rampant in that population too. If you’re a runner who doesn’t eat much meat or has heavy menstrual cycles, be especially mindful. The bottom line: iron deficiency will sap your endurance, so prioritize iron intake and keep an eye on your ferritin/hemoglobin levels.
- **Takeaway:** **Keep iron intake high and monitor status.** Eat iron-rich foods daily (especially important for female runners). Combine plant iron with vitamin C for better absorption. If you feel unusually fatigued or see performance dipping, get a blood test – iron could be the culprit. Maintaining adequate iron ensures your blood can carry the oxygen your muscles desperately need at mile 20. This holds true for elites (where a few % difference in hemoglobin can decide placings) and recreational runners (where low iron could make the difference between finishing strong or walking it in). 

### 2.2 Magnesium: Muscle Function and Energy Metabolism  
- **Why It Matters:** **Magnesium (Mg)** is involved in over 300 biochemical reactions, many relevant to exercise: it’s required for ATP production, muscle contraction/relaxation, nerve signaling, and electrolyte balance. Magnesium helps convert food to energy, so a deficiency can reduce endurance performance. It also plays a role in bone health and immune function. For runners, magnesium is critical in preventing muscle cramps and ensuring smooth muscle function. Studies indicate marginal magnesium deficiency can impair exercise capacity and increase the stress response to exercise. Marathon runners lose magnesium through sweat and urine (and possibly via GI losses if they have gut trouble in races). Additionally, heavy training can increase magnesium requirements – the body may use more Mg to meet the demands of intense exercise. Common signs of low magnesium include muscle cramps or spasms, twitchy muscles, poor sleep, and fatigue.  
- **Recommendation:** The RDA for magnesium is **~400–420 mg/day for men** and **310–320 mg/day for women** (19-50y). Some evidence suggests athletes might need slightly more, perhaps an extra 10–20% above RDA, especially if they sweat heavily. Focus on magnesium-rich foods:
  - **Nuts and Seeds:** Almonds (~80 mg per ounce), cashews (~75 mg/oz), peanuts (~50 mg/oz), pumpkin seeds (~150 mg/oz). A simple habit like a daily handful of almonds or trail mix can significantly contribute to Mg intake.
  - **Whole Grains:** Whole wheat (one cup cooked wheat berries ~160 mg), brown rice (~80 mg per cup), quinoa (~120 mg per cup). The germ and bran of grains hold magnesium; refined grains have much less.
  - **Legumes:** Black beans (~120 mg per cup cooked), edamame (~100 mg per cup), lentils (~70 mg per cup). Beans and lentils give both iron and magnesium – great for runners.
  - **Leafy Greens:** Spinach (~150 mg per cup cooked), Swiss chard (~150 mg per cup cooked). These are nutrient powerhouses (also high in iron, calcium, etc.).
  - **Others:** Dark chocolate (~65 mg per 1 oz of 70-85% dark), avocado (~58 mg per avocado). Even yogurt and bananas provide some Mg (not as high, but every bit counts – banana ~30 mg, yogurt ~30 mg per cup).
- **Ensure Adequacy:** Many people, athletes included, don’t meet the RDA for magnesium from diet alone. If you rarely eat the foods above (say your diet is heavy on refined grains and low on greens/nuts), you might fall short. Consider a **high-magnesium snack** daily, like a banana with peanut butter or a serving of trail mix with dried fruit and nuts. Making oatmeal with nuts and adding spinach to a smoothie can also stealthily boost intake.
- **Supplementation:** If you suspect your intake is low or have symptoms of deficiency, a magnesium supplement can help – but choose forms known for better absorption (e.g. magnesium citrate, glycinate, or aspartate). The dose doesn’t need to be huge: even 200–300 mg at bedtime can improve magnesium status over time (and may aid sleep, as Mg has a calming effect). Avoid taking high doses at once of magnesium oxide (common in cheap supplements), as it can cause diarrhea (it’s actually used as a laxative). It’s better to spread magnesium out (e.g. 100-150 mg morning and night). *Elites* sometimes use supplements or recovery drinks containing magnesium, especially if blood tests show they’re on the low end of normal (some testing indicates that athletes often have low normal Mg, which might be insufficient for optimal performance). *Recreational runners* could consider a supplement if dietary changes aren’t possible or if they have heavy sweat losses (e.g. those who run in hot climates or are “salty sweaters” losing lots of electrolytes).
- **Magnesium and Cramps:** There’s a bit of folklore about magnesium preventing muscle cramps. Scientific evidence on cramp prevention is mixed (electrolyte balance and neuromuscular fatigue both contribute to cramps). However, ensuring adequate magnesium (and other electrolytes like sodium and potassium) can certainly help reduce the propensity for cramping during high-intensity or prolonged exercise. At the very least, it won’t hurt and may improve overall muscle function. Many runners swear by taking a magnesium supplement (or an Epsom salt bath, which provides Mg through the skin) to ward off night-time leg cramps after long runs. This is more anecdotal, but mechanistically it makes sense since Mg is crucial for muscle relaxation.
- **Performance Impact:** Sufficient magnesium supports better oxygen delivery and energy production. One narrative review noted that marginal magnesium deficits amplify the negative effects of strenuous exercise (like high heart rate and lactate). Conversely, supplementing magnesium in those who were deficient improved exercise performance in some studies. It likely won’t make a dramatic difference if you’re already replete, but if you’re low, correcting that can make you feel less fatigued and help your endurance. Think of it this way: magnesium is part of the spark plug of muscle contraction – if it’s missing, the engine misfires.
- **Takeaway:** **Meet your magnesium needs** to support muscle and metabolic health. Eat a variety of magnesium-rich foods (nuts, whole grains, beans, leafy greens) daily. It benefits both elites and recreational runners by promoting efficient muscle contractions and aiding recovery (magnesium helps relax muscles and can improve sleep quality, which is crucial for recovery). If you experience unexplained cramping or fatigue and suspect your diet is low in Mg, talk to a doctor or dietitian – sometimes a simple supplement can solve those issues. In summary, magnesium might not be as famous as carbs or protein, but it’s a **quiet workhorse** mineral that marathoners can’t afford to neglect.

### 2.3 Sodium (and Electrolytes): Hydration and Performance  
- **Why It Matters:** **Sodium** is the chief electrolyte in extracellular fluid and is lost in significant amounts in sweat. It helps maintain fluid balance, blood pressure, and is essential for nerve impulses and muscle function. During a marathon, excessive sodium loss (coupled with overhydration) can lead to hyponatremia (low blood sodium), which is dangerous (symptoms range from nausea and headache to seizures in severe cases). Even mild electrolyte imbalances can contribute to muscle cramps and fatigue. Proper sodium intake helps you retain fluid, sustain cardiac output, and avoid performance-sapping dehydration or overhydration. Other key electrolytes for marathoners include **potassium** (important for cardiac and muscle cell function), **magnesium** (we covered), and **calcium** (for muscle contraction and bone health). But sodium is the one you must actively manage during long runs and races because losses are high and plain water can dilute it.  
- **Sweat Losses:** Sweat rate and sweat sodium content vary widely. On average, sweat contains ~1 g of sodium per liter, but “salty sweaters” can lose twice that. A marathoner might lose anywhere from 0.5 L to 2+ L of sweat per hour depending on conditions and individual factors. Over 3–5 hours, that can be **several grams of sodium lost**. If you only replace water without sodium, blood sodium can drop. Many mid- and back-of-pack marathoners have suffered hyponatremia by over-consuming water; conversely, not drinking enough leads to dehydration and high sodium concentration (hypernatremia). The goal is to strike a balance by replacing both fluid and sodium in appropriate amounts.  
- **Recommendation:** **Include sodium in your hydration plan.** The general guideline from ACSM and others is to consume **~300–600 mg of sodium per hour** during prolonged exercise (adjust up if very heavy sweat, down if light sweater). In practical terms:
  - Use **sports drinks** that contain sodium (most have ~200–400 mg per 500 mL). For instance, if you drink 16 oz (~475 mL) of Gatorade Endurance Formula in an hour, you get ~450 mg sodium.
  - Take **salt tabs or electrolyte capsules** if you are a salty sweater or in a hot marathon. Typically, one capsule has ~200–250 mg sodium. Some runners take one every 45–60 min in addition to sports drinks when it’s very hot or if they know they lose a lot.
  - Eat **salty snacks** if you can tolerate solid food (more common in ultras; in marathons, stick to drinks/gels). But something like a few pretzels at mile 20 (if offered) can provide salt and settle the stomach.
  - Ensure your **post-run hydration** also contains sodium – e.g. recovery drinks, soup, salty foods – to fully rehydrate.
- **Day-to-Day:** Outside of training, marathoners often need a bit more salt than a sedentary person. The general population is told to limit sodium (<2300 mg/day) for blood pressure reasons. But athletes who sweat a lot can typically have higher sodium diets with no issues, especially if they have low blood pressure or cramp often. Many sports dietitians advise runners not to actively restrict salt, and to **salt foods to taste**. For example, if you’re craving something salty after a long run, it’s likely your body’s way of asking for sodium – listen to it. Common marathoner diet staples like soups, bread, pretzels, tomato juice, pickles, and soy sauce on rice all provide sodium which helps with fluid retention and thirst regulation.
- **Electrolyte Balance and Performance:** Proper sodium intake helps **prevent dehydration** (by encouraging fluid retention and maintaining the drive to drink) and **prevents hyponatremia** by ensuring you don’t dilute your blood. It also can help reduce the risk of muscle cramps in those who are “salt-responsive” crampers (some evidence suggests that athletes who cramp tend to have higher sweat sodium losses and replacing sodium can mitigate cramps). During the marathon, maintaining blood volume via fluid + sodium intake helps sustain sweat rates (for cooling) and keeps your heart stroke volume up – delaying the rise in heart rate that comes with dehydration. Overall, a good hydration-electrolyte strategy means you finish the race closer to your optimal performance level rather than slowed by cardiovascular strain or overheating. 
- **Pre-Hydration:** In the day or two before a marathon, **ensure you are well-hydrated with normal electrolyte intake**. Some runners do a small “sodium load” pre-race, like drinking 500 mL of a sodium-rich beverage (~700 mg Na) the night before or morning of the race (this can expand plasma volume slightly and delay dehydration). Be careful not to overdo it (you don’t want to feel bloated or have to pee excessively at the start line). A moderate approach: include a slightly salty snack or drink (like a cup of chicken broth or a Gatorade) in your pre-marathon dinner and breakfast. **Elites** often consume a sodium-containing drink in the 90 minutes before the race to start fully topped off (e.g. 500 mL of an electrolyte drink with ~700–1000 mg Na). **Recreational** runners can mimic this, but ensure you also cut off excessive drinking ~45 min pre-start to avoid pit stops.
- **Potassium and Others:** **Potassium** works with sodium for fluid balance and muscle contraction. It’s lost in sweat too (though less than sodium). Good sources are fruits (bananas, oranges, melons), veggies, dairy, and coconut water. As long as you have a produce-rich diet, you likely meet the ~4700 mg/day potassium target (many people don’t reach that, but athletes often do due to higher food intake). Potassium helps in recovery (replenishing what’s lost). **Calcium** is more for bone and long-term muscle function – get ~1000–1300 mg/day from dairy or fortified foods, especially important for female runners to prevent stress fractures. **Magnesium** we discussed. **Zinc** and other micros (B-vitamins, vitamin C, E) should come from a balanced diet with variety (see next sub-section on supplements for more on these).
- **Elite vs Recreational:** Both need to focus on sodium around the race. **Elites** often have customized drinks with precise sodium to match sweat testing results. They may also have more access to medical guidance on hydration. **Recreational** runners should educate themselves: know that drinking to thirst is a good guideline, but in a marathon scenario you should also have a plan to ingest some electrolytes regularly (e.g. take the Gatorade at every other aid station, not just water at all). Recreational runners, especially those on the course longer, are ironically at *higher* risk of hyponatremia because they have more time to overdrink – hence, including sodium and not drinking beyond thirst is critical. 
- **Takeaway:** **Mind your electrolytes, especially sodium.** In training, don’t shy away from salty foods if you have heavy sweat workouts. During long runs and the marathon, consume sodium via sports drinks or salt caps to the tune of ~0.5 g per hour (adjust as needed). This will help maintain performance and greatly reduce the risk of hyponatremia or cramping. Post-run, rehydrate with electrolyte-rich fluids or foods (a recovery drink or even something like chocolate milk and pretzels). Remember, proper hydration is not just about chugging water – it’s about keeping your **fluid AND electrolyte** levels in balance. As the saying goes, “hydrate, don’t hyponatremia-te.” Marathoners who follow this will run safer and faster.

### 2.4 Other Micronutrients of Note  
- **Calcium & Vitamin D:** Essential for bone strength and muscle function. Marathon training puts repetitive stress on bones – adequate **calcium** (1000 mg/day for most adults, 1300 mg for teens/young adults) helps prevent stress fractures. **Vitamin D** (target blood level ~30–40 ng/mL) aids calcium absorption and muscle function; low D is linked to increased injury risk and fatigue. Get calcium from dairy (milk, yogurt, cheese) or fortified plant milks/juice, and vitamin D from sunlight or a supplement (1000–2000 IU/day if levels are low). Many runners, especially women with the Female Athlete Triad (low energy, menstrual disturbances, low bone density), need to be extra sure they get enough calcium and D to keep bones healthy. *Elites* often have blood D levels checked and supplement as needed; *recreational* runners in northern climates or who train mostly indoors should consider a D supplement, especially in winter. Strong bones carry you through training – don’t skimp on these nutrients.
- **B-Vitamins (B12, Folate, B6, etc.):** These vitamins (especially B12 and folate) are needed for red blood cell production and energy metabolism. Endurance training can slightly increase needs. Vegetarians and vegans must ensure B12 intake via supplements or fortified foods, since B12 is only in animal products. Folate is in leafy greens, beans, and fortified grains (important for women of childbearing age too). Generally, a well-rounded diet with whole grains, proteins, and greens covers B’s. If you feel low energy and iron is fine, have B12 checked – suboptimal B12 can mimic anemia. Many runners take a basic multivitamin to cover B’s, which is fine (the risk of toxicity is low since they’re water-soluble).
- **Antioxidants (Vitamin C, E, Selenium, etc.):** Marathon training produces oxidative stress which can contribute to muscle soreness and immune suppression. **Vitamin C** (in fruits like oranges, berries, kiwi, and veggies) and **Vitamin E** (in nuts, seeds, wheat germ, vegetable oils) help neutralize free radicals. **Selenium** (in Brazil nuts, seafood, grains) and **zinc** (meat, shellfish, seeds) also support immune function and recovery. The best approach is to **get antioxidants through food** – a variety of colorful fruits and vegetables daily will supply vitamin C, carotenoids (like beta-carotene in carrots/sweet potatoes), polyphenols (berries, cherries, green tea), etc., which not only reduce oxidative damage but also aid in adaptation to training. Avoid excessive antioxidant supplements (like mega-dose C or E) during heavy training – research suggests high-dose antioxidant pills can blunt some training adaptations (by reducing the body’s own antioxidant enzyme upregulation). Instead, think “food first”: e.g. tart cherry juice or blueberries post-run can reduce inflammation without overdoing it. Runners often get sick after big races due to immune stress; focusing on nutrient-dense foods (rich in C, zinc, etc.) before and after can bolster immunity. *Elites* often include lots of fruits/veggies and might take targeted supplements (like zinc lozenges or glutamine) during peak training to prevent illness. *Recreational* runners should simply ensure they are not deficient – 5+ servings of fruits/veg per day is a good target.
- **Zinc:** Important for immune function, muscle repair, and hormone production. Endurance exercise increases zinc loss through sweat and urine. Men need ~11 mg, women ~8 mg daily. Meat and shellfish are top sources (6 oysters give ~32 mg!), plus beans, nuts, and whole grains. Moderate meat intake plus some nuts usually covers it. Vegetarians should take care since plant zinc is less absorbed – soaking/sprouting beans and grains can improve zinc availability. If you get frequent colds, consider zinc levels. But don’t oversupplement – too much can interfere with copper and iron.
- **Boron, Vitamin K, etc.:** Minor players but worth a quick note: **Vitamin K** (in leafy greens) works with vitamin D and calcium for bone health – so eat your greens (spinach, kale)! **Boron** is a trace mineral that may aid bone metabolism and testosterone maintenance – found in fruits, nuts, legumes; not usually an issue if you eat varied foods. **Potassium** we mentioned – easily obtained from produce and dairy; it often doesn’t need special focus beyond eating fruits/veggies. **Iodine** (for thyroid function) is essential too; ensure you use iodized salt or eat seafood/dairy. 

In summary, *all* micronutrients are important in their own way, but the ones above are particularly relevant to marathoners. The best strategy is a **balanced, varied diet**: plenty of vegetables and fruits (for antioxidants, K, C, etc.), adequate lean proteins (for iron, B12, zinc), whole grains and nuts (for B-vitamins, magnesium, E), and dairy or alternatives (for calcium). If your diet is restrictive (vegetarian/vegan, or low-calorie for weight loss), consider a broad multivitamin-mineral supplement to cover any bases – many sports dietitians recommend endurance athletes take a daily multi as “insurance” because under-fueling or dietary gaps are common. Just ensure it’s not megadosed; a standard RDA-level multi is fine.

**Differences (Elite vs Recreational):** The main difference is elites are often more **proactive**: they get blood panels to check iron, ferritin, B12, vitamin D, etc., and adjust diet or take supplements accordingly. Recreational runners might only discover an issue after a problem arises. Ideally, recreational athletes who are serious about performance should also monitor key nutrients via periodic doctor visits or at least be mindful of deficiency signs. But cost/access can be a factor. At minimum, paying attention to diet quality will go a long way. Both elites and age-groupers should anchor their diet in whole foods. The old adage “don’t let yourself get low in the tank on anything” applies: if something runs low, it can become the weak link that limits training or race day (e.g. low iron = poor race, low calcium = stress fracture). 

**Takeaway:** **Micronutrients may be “small,” but deficiencies have big consequences.** Pay special attention to iron, magnesium, sodium, calcium, vitamin D, and antioxidants:
- Keep iron levels up with heme-rich foods and periodic checks.
- Get magnesium from nuts/greens to support muscle function.
- Use sodium strategically during long runs/races for hydration.
- Ensure calcium & vitamin D for strong bones (drink milk or fortified alt, and get sunshine or supplement).
- Eat a rainbow of fruits & veggies for vitamins C, E, K, and others – they speed recovery and bolster your immune system.
- If diet alone is insufficient or you have dietary restrictions, a daily multivitamin/mineral can help fill gaps (common among both elites and recreational runners).
  
By covering your micronutrient bases, you create a strong foundation that allows your macros (carbs, protein, fats) to do their job effectively. Think of macros as the fuel and building blocks, and micros as the spark plugs and tools that make sure the engine runs smoothly. Both elites and recreational runners will benefit from this holistic approach to nutrition.

## 3. Evidence-Based Supplements for Endurance 

Beyond everyday foods, some **ergogenic supplements** can aid marathon performance or support training when used appropriately. It’s important to emphasize evidence-based options – many products out there make big claims without scientific backing. Here we’ll cover supplements that have **strong support in sports nutrition research** for endurance athletes, including how they apply to marathoning and any nuances for elite vs. recreational use. We will focus on:
- **Caffeine** – a proven performance booster for endurance.
- **Creatine** – typically for power sports, but emerging evidence for benefits in endurance contexts.
- **Nitrates (Beetroot Juice)** – improve exercise efficiency and endurance.
- **Beta-Alanine** – buffers lactic acid, mainly useful in high-intensity efforts.
- **Electrolytes** – specifically sodium, which we covered in micronutrients (we will reiterate key points in context).
- **Others** – e.g. BCAAs, glutamine, etc., typically have weaker evidence, so the focus will remain on the heavy-hitters above.

Before diving in: **Supplements are “supplements” – they add to, but do not replace, a solid diet.** An athlete should first ensure their overall nutrition is sound (as sections 1 and 2 detailed). Once that’s in place, the following supplements can provide an extra edge or fill specific needs. Always be aware of quality and purity (for elites, ensure it’s third-party tested to avoid banned substances; for recreational, to ensure you get what you pay for). 

### 3.1 Caffeine: Proven Endurance Enhancer  
- **What It Does:** Caffeine is a stimulant that affects the central nervous system and muscles. It improves endurance performance through multiple mechanisms:
  - **Reduces perceived exertion and mental fatigue:** Caffeine blocks adenosine receptors in the brain, reducing feelings of tiredness. Marathoners often report they feel “energized” or that the effort “feels easier” after caffeine.
  - **Improves focus and mood:** It can increase alertness and even motivation, which helps in the grind of a marathon.
  - **Mobilizes fat and spares glycogen:** Caffeine can increase adrenaline, which stimulates release of fatty acids into the bloodstream. Early on, this can make the body use a bit more fat for fuel, preserving glycogen. The effect isn’t huge at marathon intensities (and doesn’t replace the need for carbs), but every bit of glycogen sparing can help delay the wall.
  - **Direct muscular effects:** Studies suggest caffeine may improve muscle fiber recruitment and contraction force, and possibly delay muscle pain by increasing endorphin release. In essence, it might help you keep firing muscle units late in the race when you’re fatigued.
  - **Increases endurance capacity:** A meta-analysis of many studies confirmed caffeine ingestion (in moderate doses) typically improves endurance time-trial performance and time-to-exhaustion by ~2–4% on average. That’s significant – for a 3:30 marathoner, 3% is ~6 minutes faster just from caffeine.
- **Usage:** The standard effective dose is **3–6 mg of caffeine per kg body weight**, taken ~60 minutes before exercise. For a 70 kg runner, that’s ~210–420 mg (roughly equivalent to 2-4 cups of coffee). Higher doses (>6–9 mg/kg) generally *don’t* give further benefits and cause more side effects (jitters, GI upset). Many athletes do fine with even less (2–3 mg/kg). In fact, research shows even **low doses (~1–2 mg/kg)** can improve endurance by increasing alertness without the potential downsides. So if you’re sensitive to caffeine, 100 mg (the amount in a smaller cup of coffee or a caffeinated gel) might still help. 
  - **Pre-Race:** Common practice is a cup of coffee (≈100–150 mg) ~1.5 hours before the start, or a caffeine pill (200 mg) 45–60 min before. Elites often take 3–4 mg/kg about an hour pre-gun. Recreational runners often naturally have a morning coffee; just timing it so it’s ~30–60 min pre-run can align its peak effect with race start.
  - **During Race:** Caffeine has a half-life of ~5 hours, so one dose can last the whole marathon for many. However, taking **additional caffeine mid-race** can help in the later stages. For example, using caffeinated gels in the second half (say at 20K and 30K marks) or sipping a caffeinated sports drink can give a “second wind.” Studies have found that a small dose (1–2 mg/kg) after ~2 hours of exercise can improve performance in the subsequent time trial. Marathon example: take ~100 mg (via a caffeinated gel or chew) at 20 miles (~32 km). This “top-up” can sharpen mental focus when fatigue is high. Be cautious not to overdo total intake – track how much you ingest. If you had 200 mg pre-race and each caffeinated gel has 40 mg, taking 3 of those still keeps you in a moderate range (200 + 120 = 320 mg).
  - **Form:** Coffee, tea, caffeine pills, caffeinated gels/chews, energy drinks (though these often have lots of sugar and other additives), or caffeine gum are all viable. Pills provide a known dose with no volume (some prefer this to avoid bathroom trips). Coffee provides caffeine plus fluid and is familiar to many (but variability in exact dose and potential GI stimulation from warm liquid to consider). Caffeine gum (e.g. Run Gum) can be chewed during the race for a quick absorption (through mouth lining) – some runners use this at mile 20 for instant perk-up.
- **Benefits for Elites vs Recreational:** **Both groups** stand to benefit similarly, as caffeine’s mechanisms apply universally. Elites might use it more systematically: nearly all professional marathoners incorporate caffeine unless they have a specific intolerance. For recreational runners, caffeine can be equally effective – maybe even more so if they haven’t historically used it (less habituated). One caveat: if a runner has **GI sensitivity**, too much caffeine can trigger pit stops (as caffeine can stimulate intestinal motility). In such cases, either use a lower dose or try a different form (some find pills cause less GI upset than coffee, for example, or splitting the dose). 
- **Habituation:** There’s debate if habitual caffeine consumption dulls the performance effect. Some older thinking was to abstain for a week prior to race to maximize effect. Current evidence suggests that while habituation might slightly reduce the magnitude, caffeine’s ergogenic benefit *still occurs* even in regular coffee drinkers. So you don’t necessarily need to go through withdrawal (which could leave you feeling awful in race week!). If you regularly consume high caffeine (e.g. >300 mg/day), you may consider tapering down a bit pre-race to reduce tolerance, but you don’t have to cut it entirely. Many athletes simply continue their normal routine (so they feel normal) and still get a boost from the race-day dose. Ultimately, do what you did in training if it worked – if you had coffee before your long runs and it helped, do the same on race day. 
- **Side Effects/Precautions:** Excess or sensitivity can cause:
  - Jitters, anxiety, elevated heart rate (bad if overdone, as it can make you go out too fast or feel panicky).
  - Gastrointestinal distress – loose stools or acid reflux. Using a lower dose or taking Imodium preventatively (some runners do) can mitigate this. Also, if coffee triggers a bowel movement (some view this as a benefit to “clear the system”), time it so you can use the restroom well before the start.
  - Insomnia if taken too late in the day (for evening races or if you have difficulty sleeping the night before a morning race – but pre-race insomnia is often more due to nerves). Generally, a morning race caffeine dose won’t affect that night’s sleep significantly.
  - **Doping rules:** Caffeine is no longer banned (it used to be monitored by the IOC pre-2004). However, extremely high urinary caffeine might raise eyebrows. As a guideline, staying at ≤6 mg/kg avoids hitting old doping thresholds. In short, normal use is fine – in fact WADA encourages it as a legal ergogenic aid – but taking like 1000 mg (which would be dangerous anyway) is unnecessary. 
- **Practical Tips:** Try caffeine in training first! Don’t let race day be the first time you take a caffeine gel if you’ve never had one. See how you respond on a long run or hard tempo. Usually, it’s beneficial (you might notice you can hold pace longer or feel better in the final miles of a 20-miler with caffeine). Also, note if it upsets your stomach. If plain coffee causes runner’s trots, perhaps switching to an espresso (less volume) or caffeine tablets is better. Timing-wise, ingest ~45–60 min pre-run for peak effect; if using gum, 15 min might suffice as it’s rapid. 
  - **Example Protocol:** 2 hours before race, eat breakfast. 45 minutes before race, consume 200 mg caffeine (via a NoDoz pill or a strong 8-12 oz coffee). During race, around the halfway or 30K mark, take one caffeinated gel (~20-50 mg). At 20 miles, pop a caffeine chew or gum (~40-50 mg). Total ~290 mg over ~4 hours – well within safe limits, and providing a sustained lift.
- **Takeaway:** **Caffeine is a well-established performance enhancer for marathons**. Use it strategically: a moderate dose before the race, and possibly small boosters during. Expect reduced perceived effort and improved focus – a valuable combination in endurance events. As an accessible supplement (coffee or tea is readily available), it’s a no-brainer for many. That said, individual tolerance varies – find your sweet spot in training. If used correctly, caffeine can help you run faster for longer, whether you’re chasing a podium or a PR. 

### 3.2 Creatine: More Than Just for Strength  
- **What It Is:** Creatine monohydrate is famous for benefits in high-intensity, short-duration exercise (like weightlifting or sprinting) as it increases phosphocreatine stores in muscle, aiding rapid ATP regeneration. **Traditionally, creatine wasn’t associated with endurance sports** because it often causes a slight weight gain (1–2 kg water weight) and primarily boosts anaerobic performance. However, emerging research suggests **creatine can assist marathoners in a few indirect ways**:
  - **Improved Recovery and Glycogen Storage:** Creatine supplementation has been shown to enhance glycogen storage when co-ingested with high carbs ([
            Creatine supplementation and endurance performance: surges and sprints to win the race - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10132248/#:~:text=co,In%20contrast%2C%20creatine)). One study found athletes who loaded creatine then loaded carbs supercompensated glycogen more than with carbs alone. For a marathoner, that could mean topping off glycogen a bit more in carb-loading. Also, creatine has cell volumizing effects (drawing water into muscle cells) and may reduce post-exercise muscle cell damage and inflammation ([
            Creatine supplementation and endurance performance: surges and sprints to win the race - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10132248/#:~:text=co,In%20contrast%2C%20creatine)). This can translate to better recovery between hard sessions, allowing higher quality training. Some data indicate creatine might reduce markers of muscle damage (like CK) and inflammation after long runs, possibly because it enhances water content and supports cellular energy availability during stress.
  - **Enhanced Finishing Kick / Speed Changes:** While marathon is mostly steady-state, there are times when a burst of speed is useful (e.g. surging to break from a pack, sprinting the last 400m). Creatine could slightly improve one’s ability to generate an “anaerobic” burst during a race ([
            Creatine supplementation and endurance performance: surges and sprints to win the race - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10132248/#:~:text=effects%2C%20particularly%20in%20weight,mixed%3B%20however%2C%20creatine%20supplementation%20appears)). It’s been shown to be beneficial in sports that combine endurance with bursts (like soccer or cycling with a sprint finish). A marathoner with creatine might have a marginally better kick at the end or handle hill surges more effectively – potentially important for elites racing tactically. 
  - **Muscle Retention in High-Volume Training:** Creatine can help maintain lean muscle mass and strength during heavy endurance training. Sometimes high mileage can lead to muscle catabolism. Creatine, by improving strength training outcomes and cell hydration, could help an athlete keep some power in their stride (particularly masters athletes who naturally lose muscle). There’s some evidence creatine might increase type IIa fiber cross-sectional area even during endurance training – meaning it might help you not lose those fast fibers entirely. That can relate to running economy or at least avoiding becoming too “fragile” from lots of mileage.
  - **Cognitive benefits:** Creatine is being studied for neuroprotective effects and cognitive function. Long, exhaustive exercise can deplete brain energy stores too. Creatine could theoretically help cognitive performance under stress. In ultra-endurance settings, creatine improved aspects of mental fatigue. In a marathon, this is more secondary, but any cognitive boost can help decision-making and pacing in the latter stages.
- **Drawbacks:** The main drawback is **weight gain** (typically 1–2 kg) due to increased water retention in muscles. For a marathoner, extra weight can slightly increase energy cost (~2 kg might slow performance by ~1% if it’s not offset by other gains). That’s why many endurance athletes avoided creatine historically. However, newer approaches involve **creatine micro-dosing or timing** so that weight gain is minimal. For example, taking 3 g/day instead of a 20 g loading dose often results in only ~0.5–1 kg gain over weeks. Additionally, some try creatine in the base training phase to gain benefits (strength, etc.), then taper off before racing to drop any water weight (creatine’s performance benefits linger for a few weeks after stopping).
- **Dosage/Usage:** The standard loading is 20 g/day for 5–7 days then 5 g/day maintenance. Athletes concerned about weight often do **slow loading**: ~3–5 g/day for 3-4 weeks (reaches saturation with less water bloating). Taking creatine with a carb/protein meal improves uptake. Many take it post-workout. For marathoners, one strategy:
  - Use creatine during the heavy training period (e.g. 8–12 weeks out to 4 weeks out). This can help with interval workouts and heavy lifting phases. 
  - Then stop or cut back in the final 3–4 weeks when tapering and focusing on weight/power ratio (some water weight will drop off during taper if you discontinue it).
  - This way you potentially got training benefits but race day you’re lighter. 
  - Some might keep a low maintenance dose (2–3 g) even through taper if they feel it helps recovery, as 2–3 g likely won’t cause much weight gain.
  
  Alternatively, some runners just accept the ~1 kg weight and use creatine through race day, especially if they’re not extremely weight-sensitive (recreational runner might not mind finishing with bigger muscles in legs vs. a minute or two slower).
- **Evidence for Endurance:** While creatine’s direct effect on steady-state endurance is ambiguous (some studies show no change in VO₂max or time trials, some show slight improvement mainly due to being able to finish stronger) ([
            Creatine supplementation and endurance performance: surges and sprints to win the race - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10132248/#:~:text=effects%2C%20particularly%20in%20weight,mixed%3B%20however%2C%20creatine%20supplementation%20appears)), the consensus is **creatine can be beneficial for endurance athletes in scenarios involving bursts of high intensity or when combined with strength training** ([
            Creatine supplementation and endurance performance: surges and sprints to win the race - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10132248/#:~:text=effects%2C%20particularly%20in%20weight,mixed%3B%20however%2C%20creatine%20supplementation%20appears)). For example, a study on cyclists showed improved performance in a final sprint after a prolonged ride with creatine. In another study, creatine+carbs allowed athletes to store more muscle glycogen and improved repeated sprint performance in a multi-day endurance event ([
            Creatine supplementation and endurance performance: surges and sprints to win the race - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10132248/#:~:text=co,In%20contrast%2C%20creatine)). It’s not a must-have like carbs or caffeine, but it's a **“situationally useful” supplement** for marathoners. If you incorporate sprints or hill bounding, or you tend to fade in the final kick, it might help. Also, if you do gym work to enhance your running economy (like heavy squats), creatine will help you lift heavier and build neuromuscular strength which could translate to improved economy on the run (some research suggests strength training plus creatine improved economy slightly more than strength alone). 
- **Elite vs Recreational:** **Elites** are split – some use creatine (especially track runners or those who come from middle-distance backgrounds who want to maintain power), others avoid due to weight. For instance, Mo Farah reportedly dabbled with creatine earlier in his career to improve kick but stopped because he felt heavy. It likely comes down to an individual’s physiology (some gain more water than others) and their event specifics (marathon vs. 10k vs. half). **Recreational runners** might find creatine helps them in training (faster intervals, feeling stronger on hills). If a recreational runner is not at the pointy end of competition where 1–2% weight matters hugely, the benefits of feeling stronger might outweigh the slight weight cost. For example, a 4:00 marathoner might prefer having more muscle to maintain good form late in the race, even if they carry an extra pound. 
- **Side Effects/Precautions:** Creatine is one of the most-researched and safe supplements. The main side effects are gastrointestinal (if taking too much at once) and the aforementioned weight gain. It doesn’t cause cramps or dehydration if you maintain normal hydration (that was an old myth). Always drink ample water when on creatine since it draws water into muscles (but as runners we already focus on hydration). Buy a reputable monohydrate product – it’s inexpensive and effective; fancy forms haven’t proven superior. 
- **Takeaway:** **Creatine can be a useful secondary supplement** for marathoners, especially to support training quality and recovery. It may help you sprint at the finish or handle surges better ([
            Creatine supplementation and endurance performance: surges and sprints to win the race - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10132248/#:~:text=effects%2C%20particularly%20in%20weight,mixed%3B%20however%2C%20creatine%20supplementation%20appears)), and it could assist in glycogen loading and muscle preservation. However, be mindful of potential weight gain. If you try creatine, do so well before race day to see how your body responds (e.g. add it in during base phase or early build, not a week before the marathon). If you find you gain minimal weight and feel stronger, great – keep it. If you feel bloated or heavy, you can discontinue. At minimum, consider using it in the off-season or in strength training blocks to build a stronger chassis for running. In summary, creatine is not essential for marathon success like carbs or caffeine, but it’s a scientifically supported tool that certain marathoners (particularly those concerned with end-race power or heavy training recovery) can exploit for marginal gains.

### 3.3 Nitrates (Beetroot Juice): Endurance Boost via Efficiency  
- **What It Is:** **Dietary nitrates**, commonly ingested via **beetroot juice** or concentrated beet shots, have emerged as a popular endurance supplement. Nitrates (NO₃⁻) convert in the body to nitric oxide (NO), a signaling molecule that causes blood vessels to dilate and improves mitochondrial efficiency and muscle contractility. The key effect for endurance athletes is **improved exercise efficiency** – essentially, you use slightly less oxygen at a given workload. This means you can either sustain a given pace with less effort or potentially go a bit faster for the same effort. 
- **Benefits for Marathoners:** 
  - **Improved running economy:** Studies show nitrate supplementation (like 500 ml beet juice or ~6-8 mmol nitrate) can reduce the O₂ cost of submaximal exercise by ~3-5%. For a marathoner, a ~5% better economy is huge – that could translate into a significant time improvement or simply feeling stronger at the same pace. Even smaller improvements (say 1-2%) could be the difference between hitting or missing a goal time.
  - **Enhanced endurance performance:** Many experiments demonstrate that nitrates can extend time-to-exhaustion and improve time-trial performance, particularly in events lasting 5–30 minutes (e.g. 5k, 10k). For longer events like a marathon, evidence is a bit more mixed but generally positive. A 2019 study on longer distance runners found those who drank beet juice for a few days had better finishes (some showing ~1-2% faster times). Another study noted that nitrates might benefit more in late-race when oxygen delivery is a limiting factor (like in final miles when muscle oxygen is lower, NO helps distribute blood flow).
  - **Potential delay of fatigue:** By improving blood flow and reducing oxygen cost, nitrates can delay the point at which your body has to shift to more anaerobic energy (which produces lactate). Some research noted that athletes on nitrates had lower lactate for a given output ([

        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6092497/#:~:text=showing%20an%20association%20between%20lower,to%20lower%20blood%20lactate%20accumulation)) and could maintain performance longer before hitting critical thresholds. 
  - **Less perceived effort:** Some athletes report they feel they can maintain pace with less strain after beetroot juice – likely tied to the physiological efficiency but also possibly NO’s effects on muscle contraction (some evidence suggests improved contractile function).
  - **Who benefits most:** Interestingly, studies indicate **nitrate’s effects are more pronounced in less-trained or non-elite individuals** ([
            Nutrition and Supplement Update for the Endurance Athlete: Review and Recommendations - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6628334/#:~:text=can%20improve%20muscle%20economy%2C%20efficiency,12%20%2C%2072%2C52%20%2C%2074)). Elites often have very efficient systems already, so nitrates sometimes show smaller gains for them. Non-elites, who may have more room for improvement in efficiency, often see bigger performance jumps. For example, a meta-analysis found 2-3% performance gains in recreational endurance athletes, vs ~0.5-1% in highly trained ones. This suggests **recreational runners could get substantial help from beetroot juice**, while elites might still get a benefit but possibly smaller (some elites still swear by it, though – it likely depends on individual nitrate status).
- **Usage:** Typically, athletes either do an **acute dose** or a **loading protocol**:
  - **Acute:** Drink ~500 ml natural beetroot juice (or ~70 ml concentrated beet shot) providing ~6-8 mmol nitrate (~300-500 mg nitrate) ~2 to 2.5 hours before exercise. Nitrate -> nitrite (in mouth, so avoid antiseptic mouthwash!) -> nitric oxide peaks in about 2-3 hours after ingestion ([
            Nutrition and Supplement Update for the Endurance Athlete: Review and Recommendations - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6628334/#:~:text=results,suboptimal%20time%20interval%20for%20exercise)). Some newer advice is to take it ~2 hours out so peak NO is during event, as it falls after ~3 hours ([
            Nutrition and Supplement Update for the Endurance Athlete: Review and Recommendations - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6628334/#:~:text=results,suboptimal%20time%20interval%20for%20exercise)). 
  - **Loading:** Ingest ~500 ml beet juice (or ~6-8 mmol nitrate via vegetables or shots) daily for 3 days leading up to the race, including on race morning ~2 hrs pre-start. Some studies found multi-day dosing saturates muscle with nitrite more and might yield more consistent results, especially in well-trained athletes.
  - Many do a combination: a beet shot each day for 3 days pre-race, and one the morning of the race. 
  - **Mouthwash caveat:** Don’t use strong mouthwash or chew gum right after taking beet – the oral bacteria converting nitrate to nitrite are essential. Even during the race, if you use a mouth rinse like some do with carbs, don’t rinse your mouth out with mouthwash or something that kills bacteria.
  - **Dosing specifics:** 6-8 mmol nitrate is often achieved with ~500 ml (~2 cups) of beet juice or two concentrated shots (each ~3-4 mmol). Some products have standardized nitrate content (e.g. Beet It Sport shots have ~6.4 mmol per 70 ml). Aim for at least 6 mmol; some go up to ~12 mmol for loading (though returns may diminish). Natural sources: ~100 g spinach or arugula can have ~3-4 mmol; 1 medium beet ~1.5 mmol. That’s a lot of veg to eat, so juice is easier. 
- **Taste/Side Effects:** Beet juice is earthy-sweet. Some love it, some gag. Concentrated shots are very strong (some mix them with a bit of apple or ginger juice to improve taste). Potential harmless side effects: **beeturia** (pink/red urine) and red stool – be aware so you don’t panic thinking it’s blood. It can also cause some stomach upset in a few people – if you have a sensitive stomach, consider a smaller dose or spread out small doses. Try it in training first. Also note blood pressure can drop a bit (NO vasodilation) – usually minor (maybe 5 mmHg less). If you already have low BP, be cautious standing up quickly after taking it. 
- **Performance Data:** Many success stories: For instance, one study found trained cyclists improved a 10km TT by ~1.2% after acute beetroot juice. Another found runners improved a 5k by ~0.5% (elites) to 1.5% (recreational). It might not sound huge, but in a marathon 1% is ~2-3 minutes for a 3:30 runner, which is meaningful. And if you’re on the bubble of qualifying for something (Boston, etc.), every second counts. Even elites in marginal gain territory look for that 0.5-1% if they can get it safely.
- **Elites vs Recreational:** As mentioned, **non-elites often see bigger benefits** ([
            Nutrition and Supplement Update for the Endurance Athlete: Review and Recommendations - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6628334/#:~:text=can%20improve%20muscle%20economy%2C%20efficiency,12%20%2C%2072%2C52%20%2C%2074)). Many pros still use it as insurance – e.g., many elite marathoners have been seen drinking beet shots (sometimes mixed into smoothies) before races. The risk is low as long as it’s tested for purity (beetroot is natural, but always good to have batch-tested products for WADA compliance to avoid any contamination issues). **Recreational runners** arguably have more to gain and should certainly consider it, especially since it’s basically like drinking a vegetable juice (which has health benefits too). 
- **Tolerance and Trial:** You should *practice beetroot supplementation in training* – e.g. drink a beet shot before a tempo run or long run and see if you feel any difference or GI issues. Some athletes feel slight stomach discomfort if they take it on an empty stomach; having it with a small carb snack might help. Also see if the timing and dose suits you (maybe one shot 2h out and another 1h out if that sits better, etc.). 
- **Other Nitrate Foods:** If you can’t do beet juice, other high-nitrate foods: spinach, arugula (rocket), celery, Swiss chard, bok choy, lettuce, parsley. For example, a large spinach salad or a smoothie with a cup of beet greens and spinach plus some beet powder could supply a few mmol. But realistically, beet juice concentrates make getting the effective dose easier. 
- **Takeaway:** **Nitrate supplementation (via beetroot juice) is a legitimate endurance aid** that can improve marathon performance by enhancing running economy and endurance capacity. It’s particularly beneficial for recreational runners (who have more room for efficiency improvement) but can also help elites in close races ([
            Nutrition and Supplement Update for the Endurance Athlete: Review and Recommendations - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6628334/#:~:text=can%20improve%20muscle%20economy%2C%20efficiency,elite%20athletes%29%20%5B12%2C51%2C52%2C53)). It’s legal and generally safe. To use it: test it in training, then incorporate a loading protocol before your goal race (e.g. beet juice each day for 3 days, including race morning ~2 hours before). Don’t overdo mouth hygiene around the time (to keep nitrate->nitrite conversion). Many athletes call beet juice their “legal rocket fuel” – indeed, it might help you “rocket” through the marathon with a bit more ease. Combined with proper training and nutrition, it can be that extra push that gets you to the finish line faster.

### 3.4 Beta-Alanine: Buffering High-Intensity Fatigue  
- **What It Is:** **Beta-alanine** is a non-essential amino acid that, when supplemented over time, increases muscle carnosine content. Carnosine acts as an intracellular buffer, soaking up hydrogen ions (H+) produced during high-intensity exercise (which causes the burning sensation and contributes to fatigue). By buffering H+, beta-alanine can **delay the onset of acidosis in muscles**, thereby prolonging high-intensity performance capacity. It’s well-proven to help in events lasting ~1–4 minutes (e.g. 800m, 1500m, rowing) by ~2–3%. For a marathon, which is mostly aerobic, beta-alanine’s direct impact is limited – you’re generally below the lactate threshold. However, it *might* help in specific marathon situations:
  - **Final Kick or Surges:** If you need to kick hard in the last 400m or push up a hill at 20 miles, those are moments of higher intensity where muscle acidosis can build. Extra buffering could let you sprint a bit faster or surge a bit longer. Not a big factor for recreational runners (who usually aren’t in a sprint finish), but for elites, could be meaningful (or even for a recreational runner who really wants to drop the hammer at the end for a PR).
  - **In-Training Benefits:** Marathoners do tempo runs and finish or start some long runs at marathon pace or faster. Beta-alanine could help in those lactate-threshold workouts by buffering lactate and potentially allowing a slightly higher intensity or volume of work. Over months, that might mean better fitness gains. Also, if you do any shorter races (5K/10K) during build-up, beta-alanine can improve those performances, which indirectly boosts your training confidence and speed reserve.
  - **Crossover to fatigue resistance:** Some studies suggest beta-alanine can reduce subjective fatigue in longer efforts and improve time-to-exhaustion even beyond the typical 1-4 min range (though evidence is not as strong here). Possibly due to central nervous system effects or because even small amounts of acidosis at threshold are buffered. 
- **Usage:** Beta-alanine needs to be loaded chronically. A typical regimen is **4–6 grams per day** (split into 2 or more doses to avoid skin tingling) for ~4–8 weeks. This can raise muscle carnosine by ~60-80%. Maintenance after loading is ~1.5–2 g/day. Effects last a while (muscle carnosine remains elevated ~3 months after stopping).
  - **Side effect – Paresthesia:** High single doses (>~800 mg) can cause a temporary flushing/tingling of the skin (especially face/hands). It’s harmless but some find it unpleasant. To avoid: use sustained-release formulas or take smaller doses spread out (e.g. 800 mg 6x/day or 1.6 g 3x/day).
  - If a marathoner wants to use it, start supplementation at least 6–8 weeks out from the race to fully load. If combining with creatine (which some do in an “all in” approach), it’s fine – no known negative interactions (some studies even show synergy for training adaptations).
- **Efficacy for Marathoners:** There isn’t much direct research on beta-alanine’s impact on marathon times. Extrapolating from other data: one meta-analysis found beta-alanine improved performance by ~2.5% in *recreational* athletes in high-intensity events vs ~1% in elites. For a marathon, the intensity is lower, so expect smaller effects. Perhaps on the order of **0.5–1% improvement** at best for an elite (maybe due to a better finish or slightly improved lactate threshold) and maybe 1–2% for a less trained runner who might accumulate more lactate at marathon pace (if their lactate threshold is lower). Note these are speculative – beta-alanine likely won’t help as much as caffeine or nitrates for a marathon. But it may give a subtle edge that could stack with other improvements.
- **Who Might Consider It:** 
  - **Elite marathoners** who do a lot of higher-intensity training or who frequently race shorter distances in season (like a track 10k or half marathon) might use beta-alanine to cover those needs. If they’re already taking it for 10k on the track, they may still have elevated carnosine come marathon – which might help in a tactical marathon race (surges, final kick).
  - **Recreational runners** probably benefit less because they rarely redline in a marathon (the goal is to avoid acidosis; if you’re in acidosis in a marathon, you went out too fast!). However, if a recreational runner also does a lot of 5Ks or is targeting improvement in lactate threshold, beta-alanine could assist in training adaptation (though evidence for adaptation is not as robust as for acute performance). Also, some recreational runners just want to try all legal aids for a potential cumulative benefit – beta-alanine is safe and not expensive, so some take it as part of their routine.
- **Combining with Other Supplements:** Beta-alanine and caffeine can complement each other (caffeine covers central fatigue, beta-alanine covers peripheral muscle fatigue). Same with nitrates – nitrates improve efficiency, beta-alanine extends high-intensity duration; they act on different fatigue factors so they can be combined (and have been in studies showing additive effects). If doing so, just manage potential GI load (e.g. don’t down a ton of beta-alanine pills plus beet juice plus coffee all at once on race morning).
- **Takeaway:** **Beta-alanine is not a primary performance booster for marathons, but it can help at the margins** – particularly for faster segments of the race or for improving high-intensity training capacity. It’s more beneficial for shorter races, but marathoners focusing on complete optimization might include it in their supplement stack. The average runner focusing purely on 26.2 might see minimal difference. But as part of a comprehensive plan (especially if you also run 5Ks/10Ks in your training cycle), beta-alanine can contribute to overall fitness improvements. If you choose to use it, load it well in advance and be patient (no immediate effect). It’s a “nice to have,” not a “need to have.” Prioritize carbs, caffeine, and perhaps nitrates first for direct marathon performance; view beta-alanine as a supplementary edge for the intense parts of running.

### 3.5 Other Supplements (Quick Mentions):
- **BCAAs / Leucine:** Branched-chain amino acids have been marketed for reducing central fatigue by competing with tryptophan transport to the brain. Some small studies showed reduced perceived exertion or less muscle soreness with BCAA during endurance events, but overall evidence is weak or mixed. A well-fed marathoner with adequate protein doesn’t likely need extra BCAA. The focus should be on total protein intake and carbs. BCAAs alone won’t boost performance (and if taken during race, might even compete with carb absorption). Better to have a complete protein in recovery than pop BCAA pills mid-run. ISSN notes BCAAs alone are inferior to whole protein for muscle maintenance.
- **Glutamine:** Popular for immune support (because hard training can lower blood glutamine, affecting immune cells). Some athletes take ~5g glutamine post-run to possibly help immunity and gut integrity. The evidence is not strong that it prevents post-marathon colds, but it’s not harmful. If you frequently get sick after races, you could try it. But focusing on carb recovery (which itself helps immune function by lowering stress hormones) is more important.
- **Antioxidant Vitamins:** As discussed, high-dose supplements (vitamin C/E mega-doses) might actually impair adaptation by blunting the natural oxidative signal that triggers improvements. It’s better to get antioxidants from diet. If you want to supplement, keep doses moderate (like 200-500 mg vitamin C, or a multivitamin with 100% DV, not 1000%).
- **Collagen / Gelatin + Vitamin C:** For tendon health, some marathoners, especially masters or those injury-prone, use collagen supplements. Taking ~10-15g gelatin or collagen with 50 mg vitamin C an hour before tendon-loading exercise (like jump rope or an easy run) has been shown to improve collagen synthesis in tendons/ligaments. This is more of an injury prevention strategy than a performance enhancer, but it could indirectly keep you healthy to train. Not needed for everyone, but worth noting.
- **Adaptogens (e.g. Rhodiola, Ashwagandha):** Some herbs claim to improve endurance or stress tolerance. Rhodiola has a bit of evidence for reducing perceived effort and improving endurance time in some studies. Ashwagandha may improve VO₂max slightly in untrained folks. These are not as evidence-backed as the supplements above and can vary in preparation. If an athlete wants to use them, they might see modest benefits (or placebo). They should ensure these are from reputable sources (especially for tested athletes, as herbal supplements sometimes contain contaminants). They are not mainstream ergogenics like caffeine/nitrates, so consider them optional and secondary.
- **Sodium Bicarbonate:** This is a buffer like beta-alanine but works extracellularly for events 1–10 minutes, by ingesting baking soda (which raises blood pH). It’s been used by 800m/1500m runners with success. For a marathon, it’s not helpful (because marathoners don’t go anaerobic enough to need it throughout). Plus, bicarb often causes GI upset (diarrhea) – not desirable in a marathon. So this is not recommended for marathon (and one wouldn’t want to deal with potentially running for porta-potties more than running for time).
- **Glycerol:** Used for hyperhydration in the past. Now banned by WADA (though presumably not relevant for non-elites), but even aside from that, strategies like pre-race glycerol loading to retain extra fluid have fallen out of favor because careful normal hydration plus sodium is safer. Glycerol can cause headaches and is tricky. Not needed if you follow current hydration guidelines.
- **L-Carnitine:** Involved in fat transport into mitochondria, theoretically more carnitine = better fat burn. But oral carnitine supplements don’t absorb well unless insulin is spiked, and studies haven’t shown clear endurance performance improvements. Some found maybe less muscle damage or slight improved recovery. Elite athletes have tried carnitine injections (which is not widely accessible or advisable). Overall, focus on training to improve fat utilization rather than supplements like carnitine.
- **Multivitamin/Mineral:** As mentioned, a general multi can “cover your bases” for micronutrients not easily attained in diet (e.g. iron, zinc, selenium, iodine). Many runners take one daily. It likely doesn’t directly boost performance unless you were deficient, but it can prevent deficiencies from developing during heavy training when demands are high. Choose a quality one with no more than 100-200% of most values. *Elites* often do blood tests and then selectively supplement (like just iron, D, etc., rather than a full multi), but some still take a multi as backup. *Recreational* runners might not test as often, so a multi ensures they aren’t low in something unknown.
- **Protein Powders:** Not exactly a performance supplement, but worth noting: whey or plant protein powders are convenient to help meet protein needs and can be especially useful for recovery shakes. They don’t directly enhance performance beyond aiding recovery and adaptation. But since adequate protein is crucial, powders can be a helpful part of marathon nutrition (especially for vegetarians or those who struggle to eat right after a run). Whey in particular is high in leucine and quickly absorbed – great for muscle repair (and contains some glutamine and immunoglobulins that might help immunity). Casein (in milk or as powder) is good at night for sustained amino acid release. Use as needed to hit your ~1.2-1.6 g/kg protein.

## 4. Putting It All Together: Marathon Nutrition in Practice  

We’ve covered macronutrient ratios, key micronutrients, and useful supplements. Now let’s synthesize how these translate into concrete strategies for **training, race week, race day, and recovery** with clear **practical recommendations**. Finally, we’ll summarize the key findings and differences between elites and recreational runners.

### 4.1 Training Diet and Long Run Nutrition  
**Daily Training Diet:** In marathon training, consistency is king – that applies to nutrition too. Concretely:
- **Carbs:** Aim for **high-carb meals around workouts**. For example, if you run in the morning, have a carb-focused breakfast after (e.g. cereal + fruit + yogurt). If a long run is in the morning, do a carb-rich dinner the night before (pasta, rice, etc.). On heavy mileage days, include starches at lunch and dinner (rice, potatoes, bread) plus carb snacks (fruit, trail mix) to reach your g/kg target. A typical day for a 140 lb (64 kg) runner might be ~400 g carbs: e.g. breakfast oatmeal & banana (80g), mid-morning bagel (50g), lunch rice bowl (100g), afternoon granola bar (30g), dinner pasta (120g), evening fruit & yogurt (20g). Spread out is key to avoid feeling too bloated at once.
- **Protein:** Distribute ~20–25 g protein in each main meal and in recovery snacks. Real-world examples: 
  - Breakfast: 2 eggs (12g) + 1 cup Greek yogurt (15g) = ~27g.
  - Lunch: Turkey sandwich (3 oz turkey ~24g, cheese 7g) = ~30g.
  - Snack: Protein smoothie with whey (20g).
  - Dinner: Salmon fillet 5 oz (~35g) + quinoa (5g) = 40g.
  - Total ~117g (~1.8 g/kg for a 64 kg runner – on high end, which is fine in hard training).
  - Vegetarian approach might use tofu, beans, tempeh, seitan, and dairy/eggs (or if vegan, more legumes and maybe a plant protein shake).
- **Fats:** Include healthy fats each meal in moderation. For instance, use olive oil on salad and veggies (1–2 tbsp), have a quarter-cup of nuts or 2 tbsp peanut butter (a couple times a day), maybe some avocado on a sandwich. This will usually net 60-80g fat without trying too hard. Just avoid super greasy choices before key runs.
- **Hydration:** During training, **stay hydrated**. Start runs euhydrated (clear/light urine). For runs under 60–90 min, water is fine. For longer runs or very sweaty sessions, **use sports drinks** to practice fueling and electrolyte intake. Example: On a 18-mile run (say 3 hours), you might drink 16 oz Gatorade per hour (~500 mL, 20g carb, 220mg Na) and take a gel at 60 and 120 min. That both hydrates and gives ~~ 60g carbs total – similar to race plan. **Training the gut** with these fuels is crucial so your stomach handles it on race day. 
- **Micronutrient Emphasis:** Ensure each day has:
  - At least 5 servings of fruits/veggies (vitamins, minerals, antioxidants).
  - Iron sources (red meat 2-3x/week or plant sources daily with vitamin C) – female runners especially should do this.
  - Dairy or alternative for calcium 2-3x/day (or take Ca+vit D supplement if intolerant).
  - Salty foods around big sweat days (could be as simple as sprinkling salt on meals or having pretzels).
  - A variety of whole foods to naturally cover B-vitamins, zinc, magnesium, etc. (E.g. whole grain bread or cereal, a handful of nuts or seeds, dark leafy salad).
- **Pre-Run Snacks:** For quality workouts, have easily-digested carbs beforehand (especially if >90 min or high-intensity). Example: a banana or a slice of toast with jam 30–60 min before an afternoon run can improve performance in that session. For morning runs, if you can’t eat much, maybe just a sports drink or some chews to give a bit of sugar to work with. (This trains your gut too, preventing issues on race day when you'll likely have breakfast). 
- **Supplements in Training:** If you plan to use caffeine, practice with coffee or caffeine tablets before some long/tempo runs to gauge effect. If taking beta-alanine, you’ll be doing that daily. Creatine could be taken during a strength training phase (e.g. the first 8 weeks of training cycle) then stopped if weight is a concern. Beet juice can be used occasionally before a very hard workout to simulate the race boost or daily during a peaking block to see how you feel (though it's more common to save for race week). Definitely use training to dial in any electrolyte supplements (e.g. salt pills on a hot long run to see how your stomach responds).

**Long Run/Race Simulation:** Treat a few long runs as rehearsal:
- Eat a similar **carb-heavy dinner** the night before (and note how foods sit with you).
- **Pre-run breakfast** trial: e.g. bowl of cereal + banana + coffee 2 hours before the long run. Or bagel + peanut butter + sports drink. Figure out how much and what types your gut tolerates (some need low fiber, others are fine).
- **Fuel during the long run** exactly as you plan to in the race: e.g. 1 gel every 5 miles with water, sports drink sips in between. This will train the intestinal transporters to absorb carbs better and reduce risk of GI distress on race day.
- Use your **planned supplements** if any (caffeine pill, beet juice shot, etc.) to see how timing works and if they indeed seem to help (most likely yes for caffeine/beet).
- Afterwards, practice your **recovery routine** (carb-protein refueling within 30–60 min, maybe an electrolyte-rich drink). Over months, this will refine what protocols make you feel best.

### 4.2 Taper Week and Marathon Race-Day Nutrition  
**Taper Week (Last 7–10 days):** Training volume decreases, and nutrition focus shifts to maximizing muscle glycogen, staying healthy, and not gaining bad weight (some minor weight gain from glycogen water storage is fine).
- **Carbohydrate Loading:** Usually begins ~2–3 days before race (for a Sunday race, likely starting Friday morning). During those final 48–72 hours:
  - Increase carbs to ~70% of daily calories. For many, this means **~8–10 g/kg**. It’s okay to cut back slightly on protein and fat those days to accommodate extra carbs (since taper reduces calorie burn somewhat).
  - Choose familiar, lower-fiber carbs to avoid GI bloating. Emphasize refined grains and simple sugars more than you normally would (this is the time to enjoy white bread, regular pasta, rice, pretzels, etc. – fiber is great normally, but too much now can cause gut fullness on race morning).
  - Example carb-loading menu for a 60 kg runner targeting ~500g carbs:
    - Breakfast: 2 cups pancakes (~90g) with syrup (~30g) + 8 oz sports drink (~15g). (Total ~135g)
    - Snack: Banana (~30g) + 2 fig bars (~40g). (70g)
    - Lunch: Large white bagel (~50g) with honey (~15g) + 12 oz fruit smoothie (~45g). (110g)
    - Snack: 2 cups pretzels (~50g) + sports drink (~15g). (65g)
    - Dinner: Big plate of pasta (~100g) with marinara (10g) + white roll (~25g) + sorbet for dessert (~30g). (165g)
    - Total ~545g carbs. This is a lot of food volume, which is why spreading through the day and choosing more refined sources helps (they're less bulky per gram of carb).
  - If you feel bloated, you might incorporate liquid carbs (sports drinks, carb-rich smoothies, juice) because they provide carbs without filling you up as much.
  - Continue a moderate amount of protein (you still need it for muscle repair in taper, and to avoid losing muscle). E.g. maybe 1.0 g/kg protein these days. Don’t cut out fat entirely – include small amounts (it’ll help you avoid blood sugar rollercoasters).
  - Keep **hydration** high too – glycogen storage requires water, and you want to be fully hydrated (but not over-hydrated) going into race morning. So drink to thirst plus a bit extra. Perhaps include an electrolyte beverage (with sodium) once a day to ensure sodium levels are good (especially if you stopped heavy training and thus sweating less – still keep salt intake normal).
- **Micronutrients Taper:** Eat your fruits and veggies as usual (some reduce veggie portions a bit because of fiber, but don’t cut them out entirely – you can peel apples, have fruit juice, or cooked veggies which are lower fiber than raw). Definitely make sure iron-rich foods are in (last chance to top off ferritin a bit), and keep up vitamin C to support immune system (many get nervous-sick in taper; good nutrition and enough sleep helps).
- **Supplement Taper:** This is when you'd do the beetroot loading if planned (3 days out). If you loaded beta-alanine, you can actually stop in taper if you want (muscles stay loaded) to simplify race supplement schedule. Continue creatine only if you decided to (if concerned about weight, taper off it ~2 weeks out). Definitely continue things like a multivitamin if you take one – in fact, some do a course of vitamin C (like 500 mg/day) in the 5 days pre-race as immune insurance (some evidence vitamin C can reduce risk of colds in heavy exercisers, although best is to just not be deficient).
- **Avoid new foods:** The golden rule: **Nothing new before race.** During taper, eat foods your body is used to. Don’t suddenly try exotic cuisine or very spicy food in days before race – GI might rebel. Stick to simple, familiar staples.
- **Weight in Taper:** It’s normal to gain ~1–3 lbs during carb-loading due to water stored with glycogen. Don’t panic – that’s expected and will fuel you on race day. It’s not fat (assuming you didn’t go crazy on junk food). Some elites actually cut fiber to drop “bulk weight” from intestines pre-race – known as "low residue diet". For example, they might avoid big salads or whole grains those last 2 days so that gastrointestinal contents are minimized at start (makes you lighter by maybe a half pound and reduces risk of mid-race pit stops). Recreational runners can do a mild version: choose easily digestible foods and not overdo fiber in final 24 hours.
- **Pre-Race Dinner (Night Before):** Should be **high in carbs, moderate protein, low-moderate fat, low fiber**. Classic example: white pasta with a little olive oil and chicken breast, white bread, and maybe a small dessert (low-fat frozen yogurt or something). Avoid heavy cream sauces or big steaks (harder to digest). Also avoid gas-formers (excess broccoli, beans) tonight. And nothing extremely spicy or unfamiliar. Aim to eat on the earlier side (finishing ~12 hours before race start or more) so you have time to digest overnight. Drink a glass of water or sports drink with it, but don’t force gallons of fluid.
- **Evening Snack:** If you have a long time between early dinner and bed, a light carb snack (like pretzels or half a bagel or a sports drink) before bed can ensure liver glycogen is topped off for the morning. Keep it small to avoid stomach sleeping issues.

**Race Morning (Breakfast):** This is a critical meal:
- **Timing:** Ideally **3–4 hours before start** for a full meal. Many races start around 7–8am, so that means 3-4am wake-up, which is tough. If you can’t do that, have breakfast at least **2 hours out**, but then keep it a bit smaller. You can then take a last-minute top-off (gel or carb drink) ~15 min before gun to add quick fuel if needed.
- **Composition:** **1–4 g/kg of carbs** (depending on timing), a little protein (~5–10g, but not crucial), **low fat, low fiber**. Roughly 300–600+ calories mostly from carbs. Examples:
  - Oatmeal made with water, topped with a banana and honey. (~100 g carb if a sizable bowl, ~6 g protein, very low fat).
  - Two white bagels with jam and a little peanut butter (if tolerated). (~120 g carb, 10 g protein, 10 g fat – fat a bit high, could do one with PB, one with just jam).
  - Pancakes or waffles with syrup and a sports drink. (~90 g carb from 3 pancakes + 30 g from sports drink = 120 g).
  - Rice porridge with a bit of soy sauce and a hard-boiled egg. (~80 g carb from rice, 6 g protein from egg, minimal fat).
  - If nerves prevent a solid meal, consider liquid options: fruit smoothie (e.g. blend 2 bananas, some strawberries, and a scoop of carb powder or maltodextrin – could be ~80 g carb) or sip on a carb-rich drink (like 2 bottles of Gatorade = ~60 g) and have a few low-fiber cookies or gels to reach target.
- **Fluids:** Aim for ~5 ml/kg fluid with breakfast (350 ml for 70 kg) and another ~3 ml/kg (210 ml) in the 2 hours pre-start. Essentially, drink a couple glasses of water or sports drink with your meal, and then keep sipping modestly. Stop large intakes ~60 min out to allow kidneys to process excess – you can take a last small 100–200 ml drink 15 min out if thirsty. The goal is to be well-hydrated but not have a sloshing stomach or need to pee at mile 2. If you tend to not pee much before races, cut off fluids earlier. 
- **Electrolytes:** Include some salt in breakfast (e.g. sports drink has some, or a little salted pretzels). Some runners take 1 salt capsule with breakfast to ensure sodium (particularly if they sweat a lot and it’s a warm morning). If it’s hot, also consider a technique: drink ~300-400 ml of an electrolyte drink 1–2 hours out, in addition to sipping water – this "hyperhydrates" slightly with sodium so you start topped off. But again, not overboard so you aren’t in the porta-potty line repeatedly.
- **Caffeine:** If you’re a coffee person, definitely have your coffee. It will give you that caffeine boost and usually help with a bowel movement. Just time it so you can go to the bathroom at least once (most aim to poop before heading to start). If not coffee, take your planned caffeine pill ~60 min out. Many do both (coffee at 3 hours, then a caffeine gel 15 min out). Ensure you practiced whatever you do.
- **Beetroot Juice:** If following that plan, drink your beet shot ~2 hours before. Some take one the evening prior too. If it’s a concentrated 70 ml shot, you can do one ~2h and even one ~1h pre-start (2 shots ~8 mmol) if you tolerate it.
- **Final 30 min:** Stop drinking anything significant by ~20–30 min to go (hit the porta-potty one last time). In the final 10 minutes, many runners take a last **energy gel (with water)** or sip a carbohydrate drink. This raises blood glucose which can be beneficial especially if you had breakfast 3+ hours before and might be on the verge of running low on liver glycogen. A caffeinated gel here can also top up caffeine levels. If you do this, ensure you have practiced a pre-run gel and that you have access to water to wash it down properly. If not, you could just do a small swig of sports drink. Some prefer not to spike sugar right at start to avoid an insulin response dip – research is mixed, but most show that even if insulin rises, once you start running it’s fine and the carbs help ([

Marathon performance hinges on **smart nutrition** – both in daily training and on race day. Below we break down key recommendations for **macronutrients**, **micronutrients**, **proven supplements**, and **practical food strategies** for marathoners. We highlight differences (or lack thereof) between **elite and recreational runners**, and end with a concise summary of **key takeaways and recommendations**.

## 1. Macronutrient Balance for Marathon Training and Racing

**Marathoners must prioritize carbohydrates, ensure adequate protein, and include healthy fats** to support high training loads and optimal race performance. The ratios may shift slightly (e.g. more carbs during peak training and race week), but all three macros play crucial roles:

### 1.1 Carbohydrates – The Primary Fuel  
**Why:** Carbs provide glucose to fuel running and stockpile **muscle glycogen**, the critical energy reserve for long efforts. High-carb diets enhance endurance capacity, while low-carb intake leads to premature fatigue (“hitting the wall”). 

**Daily targets:** Endurance nutrition guidelines call for **5–7 g of carbs per kg body weight per day** during moderate training (~1 hour/day), **6–10 g/kg/day** for heavy training (1–3 hours/day), and up to **8–12 g/kg/day** during maximal loads or carb-loading. For example, a 70 kg runner might need ~420–700 g of carbs on training days depending on volume. In practice, this means **60–70% of daily calories from carbs** for most marathoners. 

**Sources:** Emphasize quality carbs: pasta, rice, quinoa, bread, oatmeal, potatoes, fruits, starchy vegetables, and sports products (drinks, gels) around workouts. Include some high-GI (quick) carbs after runs to speed glycogen restoration (e.g. fruit juice or white rice) and plenty of moderate/low-GI carbs in meals for sustained energy (e.g. whole grains, sweet potatoes).

**Training nutrition:** Fuel key workouts and long runs with carbs:
- **Before workouts:** Consume ~1–4 g/kg of easy-to-digest carbs in the 1–4 hours pre-run. For a morning run, that could be a bagel + banana 2 hours prior (~100 g carbs for a 60 kg runner). Well-fueled training allows you to hit target paces.
- **During long runs (>90 min):** Practice taking **30–60 g of carbs per hour** during running (sports drink, gels, chews). This not only trains your gut for race day but also helps spare muscle glycogen, letting you finish long runs stronger.
- **After workouts:** Consume **~1.0–1.2 g/kg of carbs** in the first hour post-run to rapidly replenish glycogen. Combine with protein (see below) for better recovery. For instance, after a 20-mile run, a 70 kg runner might drink a 24 oz sports drink (40 g carbs) and eat a bagel with jam (50 g) immediately, then a high-carb meal an hour later.

**Carb-loading (race week):** Topping off glycogen stores pre-race is crucial for both elites and recreational runners. In the final 2–3 days before the marathon, **taper training and increase carbs to ~8–12 g/kg/day**. This may be ~500–700+ g of carbs (3,000+ kcal from carbs) per day for many runners. Focus on *low-fiber, easily digested carbs* (white rice, pasta, bread, bananas, sports drinks) to avoid GI bloating. Carb-loading can improve performance ~2–3% by ensuring maximal glycogen at the start. Elite runners often carb-load meticulously (even doing multiple small carb meals per day) – but recreational runners benefit just as much from this practice. *(See section 4 for specific carb-loading meal examples.)*

**Race fueling:** During the marathon, take in **~30–60 g of carbs per hour** (ideally ~60 g if tolerated) via energy gels, chews, and sports drinks. This sustains blood glucose in later miles and delays the wall. Elites often consume ~60–80+ g/hr (e.g. 1 gel every 5K with sports drink), whereas recreational runners should aim for at least a gel (20–30 g) every 30–45 min plus sports drink – *practiced in training*. Consistent in-race fueling can markedly improve finish times and reduce “bonking”.

**Don’t “train low” long-term:** Chronic low-carb or keto diets are **not** recommended for marathoners – they can impair high-intensity capacity and don’t show performance benefits in well-trained runners. While enhancing fat burn is useful, it’s best achieved via training, not carb restriction. The slogan in modern sports nutrition is *“train low (occasionally), but race high (carbs)”*. In other words, some elite programs include a few low-glycogen easy runs to stimulate adaptations, but they always ensure high carb availability for quality workouts and races. Recreational runners are usually better off staying well-fueled to support training quality and recovery.

**Key point:** **Carbohydrates are the marathoner’s most important fuel.** Both elites and recreational runners should center their diet on carbs – especially around training and leading into the race. As a rule of thumb, include a significant carb source at every meal and snack. If in doubt, eat that extra potato or take that extra gel – under-fueling with carbs is a common mistake that limits performance. 

### 1.2 Protein – Repair, Rebuild, Recover  
**Why:** Protein provides amino acids to **repair muscle damage** from training and to build/maintain enzymes and lean tissue that improve performance. While running is primarily aerobic, marathoners still incur micro-tears in muscle fibers (especially after long runs or hill workouts). Adequate protein speeds recovery, reduces muscle soreness, and helps adapt to training (e.g. building more mitochondria). It also supports the immune system, which can be stressed by high mileage.

**Daily targets:** Aim for **1.2–1.6 g of protein per kg body weight per day**. For a 60 kg (132 lb) runner that’s ~72–96 g protein/day; for an 80 kg (176 lb) runner ~96–128 g/day. This is higher than the general RDA (0.8 g/kg) because endurance training increases protein turnover. **Elite runners** often target the upper end (~1.5–1.7 g/kg) especially during heavy training or if trying to lose fat without losing muscle. **Recreational runners** should hit at least ~1.2 g/kg – many recreational athletes under-eat protein, which can slow recovery. 

**Sources:** Lean meats (chicken, turkey, lean beef, pork tenderloin), fish, eggs, low-fat dairy (milk, yogurt, cheese), and plant proteins (tofu, tempeh, beans, lentils, nuts, seeds). Whey or plant-based protein powders can help if whole-food intake is insufficient – a common strategy for a quick recovery shake. Choose high-quality proteins rich in essential amino acids (especially leucine which triggers muscle repair). 

**Distribution:** **Spread protein evenly** across meals for best results. The body can use ~20–30 g at a time for muscle protein synthesis; beyond that, it’s less efficiently used. So, aim for **~0.3 g/kg per meal** (≈20 g for a 60–70 kg person) and include some protein in snacks. For example:
- Breakfast: 3 eggs or Greek yogurt + granola (~20–25 g protein) 
- Lunch: Turkey sandwich + milk (~25–30 g) 
- Afternoon snack: Protein bar or smoothie (~15–20 g) 
- Dinner: Grilled fish + quinoa + veggies (~30 g) 
- Post-dinner snack (if needed): Cottage cheese or a glass of milk (~10–15 g)

This kind of distribution ensures a steady supply of amino acids all day to support continuous recovery. Both elites and recreational runners should avoid the common pattern of little protein all day and a huge portion at dinner – spreading it out is more effective for muscle repair.

**Post-workout protein:** Consuming **~15–25 g of protein within 30–60 minutes after exercise** accelerates muscle repair and adaptation. Pair this with carbs (e.g. chocolate milk has 8–10 g protein, 30 g carbs per cup – an excellent recovery drink). For instance, after a hard tempo run, an elite might have a recovery shake with 20 g whey protein + 60 g carbs, while a recreational runner might have a PB&J sandwich (10 g protein, 50 g carbs) + a cup of yogurt (8–10 g protein). Consistent post-run protein helps reduce muscle soreness and prepares you for the next session. 

**Protein and weight management:** Protein is satiating and helps preserve muscle during weight loss. Many marathoners, especially elites, slightly decrease body fat during training. They often maintain protein at the higher end (~1.6–2.0 g/kg) during calorie deficits to minimize muscle loss. Recreational runners who aim to shed a few pounds should do similarly: keep protein high and cut mainly from fat or sugary foods, not from protein or carbs (since carbs fuel training). 

**Differences:** **Elites** are usually meticulous about protein – they incorporate it in every meal and recovery period to speed up turnaround between intense sessions. They might also use night-time protein (casein) to enhance overnight recovery. **Recreational runners** sometimes overlook protein (focusing only on carbs), but they too need it for recovery and injury prevention. If anything, recreational runners (who often juggle work/life stress) benefit from protein’s immune-support and appetite-control aspects as well. The fundamental protein needs don’t differ much by level – just that elites often have dialed-in habits (and sometimes more supplements like amino acids, etc.), whereas recreational runners should ensure they meet the recommended range with whole foods or convenient shakes.

**Key point:** **Get enough protein and space it out.** This keeps your muscles recovering and ready for the next run. A good guideline is at least ~20 g protein at breakfast, lunch, and dinner, plus protein-rich snacks or recovery drinks as needed. Think *“carbs for fuel, protein for repair”*. One fuels the performance, the other rebuilds afterward – you need both in harmony to sustain marathon training and improve. 

### 1.3 Fats – Essential Nutrients & Endurance Support  
**Why:** Dietary fats are vital for **overall health, hormone production, and as a secondary fuel source**. They provide essential fatty acids (omega-3 and omega-6) that reduce inflammation and support cell membranes, and aid absorption of fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, K). During long runs, the body increasingly burns fat for energy (especially at moderate intensities) – well-trained marathoners become very efficient at utilizing fat, which spares glycogen. However, this is more about training adaptation than high-fat eating. Marathoners need sufficient fat in the diet to maintain health (too low fat can lead to issues like low testosterone or missed menstrual cycles). 

**Daily targets:** Aim for **20–35% of total calories from fat**. In practice, most endurance athletes thrive around ~25–30% of calories from fat. This typically equates to **~1–1.5 g of fat per kg body weight**. For example, a 2500 kcal/day diet at 25% fat = ~70 g fat. A 3500 kcal/day diet (typical for an elite) at 30% fat = ~117 g fat. **Do not drop below ~0.5 g/kg** long-term (which would be <15% calories) as that can impair absorption of nutrients and recovery. Marathoners often naturally fall in the 0.8–1.2 g/kg range if they eat balanced meals.

**Types of fat:** Emphasize **unsaturated “healthy” fats**:
- *Monounsaturated:* Olive oil, avocados, peanuts, almonds, cashews.
- *Polyunsaturated:* Walnuts, chia seeds, flaxseed, sunflower seeds, fatty fish (salmon, tuna, mackerel).
  - Particularly **Omega-3s** (from fish, flax, chia, walnuts) are anti-inflammatory and may help recovery and heart health.
- **Limit** saturated fat (found in butter, high-fat cheese, fatty cuts of meat) to ~10% of calories – some is fine, especially if from quality sources (e.g. yogurt, which also provides protein and calcium), but heavy diets of fried foods or fatty meats can increase inflammation and aren’t as nutrient-dense. **Avoid** trans fats (found in some processed snacks and margarine) altogether for health.

**Timing:** There’s no need to precisely time fat intake around workouts. The main guideline is **avoid large amounts of fat immediately before running or during runs**, since fat slows gastric emptying and can cause GI distress. For example, don’t eat bacon and sausage right before a morning interval session – that can sit heavy. Instead, keep pre-run meals low-fat (e.g. choose toast with a little peanut butter over a greasy breakfast sandwich). **During the marathon, do not consume fats** – stick to carbs for quick energy. Fats eaten mid-race (like nuts or energy bars with fat) can cause stomach issues and won’t provide immediate fuel. Save fat-containing foods for before/after running. 

**In training diet:** Include some fat in each regular meal for satiety and nutrients – e.g.:
- Add a tablespoon of nut butter to your oatmeal (healthy fat + some protein).
- Use olive oil or avocado in salads or on sandwiches.
- Snack on a small handful of nuts or trail mix daily.
- Include oily fish (rich in omega-3) 1–2 times a week (or consider fish oil supplements if you don’t eat fish).
- Use full-fat or 2% dairy if tolerated – it provides fat plus protein (many elites drink regular milk or have yogurt; the fat helps with vitamin D absorption and satiety).
This usually organically hits ~70+ g fat a day without special effort. 

**Don’t overdo or underdo:** 
- **Too little fat (<15% calories)** can lead to low energy availability, hormonal disruptions (especially in female athletes leading to menstrual irregularities and bone loss), and constant hunger. Some marathoners (especially recreational ones trying to lose weight) mistakenly cut almost all fat – this can backfire by making the diet unsustainable and depriving them of nutrients like vitamin E and essential fatty acids. 
- **Too much fat (>35% calories)** typically means you’re replacing carbs – which can hurt training quality. High-fat diets also can increase GI transit time, which might contribute to constipation or heaviness. The well-known “keto” approach drastically reduces carbs and ups fat; studies show while it increases fat burn, it usually *impairs* performance in events like marathons due to lowered exercise economy and ability to hit high intensities. Thus, a balanced approach is best: moderate fat intake ensures you get benefits of fat (fuel at low intensity, nutrient absorption, anti-inflammatory effects) without displacing the high carbs you need.

**Elite vs Recreational:** **Elites** tend to naturally consume moderate fat – they eat nutrient-dense foods and usually aren’t fat-phobic. They will adjust fat intake in specific scenarios: e.g. before important races, they might reduce fat (and fiber) for a couple days simply to avoid any GI load (not to cut calories, but to prioritize carbs and reduce digestive residue). **Recreational** runners might have more variability – some eat very fatty diets which can crowd out carbs (e.g. a lot of fast food), while others (particularly female runners concerned about weight) sometimes cut fat too much and suffer issues (fatigue, hair loss, amenorrhea). The guidance for both is similar: keep fat in a moderate range and focus on **quality** of fats. 

One difference: a sub-set of recreational/ultra-endurance runners experiment with high-fat or “train low” (low carb) protocols to boost fat metabolism. If done, it should be periodized (only on some easy runs, and still loading carbs for intensity and racing). But most evidence suggests marathon racing is best supported by ample carbs, so even if fat adaptation is pursued in training, the race diet should still be high-carb (“race high”). 

**Key point:** **Maintain a moderate fat intake with emphasis on healthy fats.** This supports overall health and provides a backup fuel source without interfering with carb needs. In practice: drizzle olive oil on pasta and vegetables, snack on nuts, include avocado or nut butter daily, choose salmon over deep-fried foods. And crucially, **limit fats right around runs** (especially long runs and races) to keep your stomach settled. Achieving this balance ensures you reap fat’s benefits (hormonal health, reduced inflammation) while staying *carb-fueled* for performance.

**Macronutrient Summary:** *“Carbs are for going, protein is for growing (repair), fat is for glowing (health)”*. Marathoners need all three:
- **Carbs:** The bulk of calories, scaled to training load, timed around workouts and races. 
- **Protein:** Spread through the day, critical after runs, meeting ~1.2–1.6 g/kg for recovery and muscle maintenance.
- **Fat:** Included in moderation, focusing on unsaturated sources, enough to maintain health but kept low during key fueling windows.

Both elites and recreational runners thrive on these principles – differences lie mostly in fine-tuning and absolute quantities, not in the fundamental approach.

## 2. Micronutrients – Small Nutrients with Big Impact

Micronutrients (vitamins and minerals) often don’t get the spotlight, but **deficiencies can derail performance and recovery**. Marathoners must ensure adequate intake of several key micros:

### 2.1 Iron – Oxygen Delivery and Energy  
**Why:** **Iron** is the cornerstone of hemoglobin and myoglobin, which carry oxygen in blood and muscle. If iron is low, your blood can’t transport oxygen efficiently, slashing endurance and causing fatigue. Iron also helps produce energy in cells. Marathoners (especially women) are prone to iron deficiency due to:
- Sweating and foot-strike hemolysis (red blood cell destruction from foot impact) which cause iron loss.
- Menstrual losses in female runners.
- Inadequate iron intake (vegetarians/vegans and dieters at higher risk).
- High training volume (which can increase iron needs/utilization).

**Impacts:** Low iron (ferritin < ~30 µg/L or iron-deficiency anemia) leads to poor performance, heavy legs, and longer recovery. It’s a major cause of “unexplained” fatigue in endurance athletes. *Elites* monitor iron closely – many get blood tests each season and use supplements if ferritin is dropping. *Recreational* runners should be mindful too: if you’re feeling unusually tired or your pace feels harder than it should, have your iron levels checked.

**Needs:** Female runners should aim for **~18 mg iron per day**, males ~8–10 mg (due to no menstrual loss). Some experts suggest athletes might benefit from even ~1.3x the RDA. Rather than chasing numbers, focus on **iron-rich foods daily**:
- **Heme iron (best absorbed):** Lean red meat (beef, venison, bison, lamb), dark poultry, liver, seafood (clams, oysters). *E.g.* a 3-oz serving of beef has ~2–3 mg iron; 3 oz chicken thigh ~1 mg; 6 oysters ~5 mg.
- **Non-heme iron:** Beans, lentils, tofu, spinach, fortified cereals, pumpkin seeds, quinoa. *E.g.* 1 cup cooked lentils ~6.6 mg; 1 cup cooked spinach ~6 mg; many breakfast cereals ~8–18 mg (check label).

**Enhance absorption:** Pair iron foods with **vitamin C** (which converts iron to a more absorbable form) ([
            Exploring the Relationship between Micronutrients and Athletic Performance: A Comprehensive Scientific Systematic Review of the Literature in Sports Medicine - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10302780/#:~:text=Iron%20deficiency%2C%20whether%20combined%20with,Dairy%20products%2C%20sardines%20and%20salmon)). *E.g.* have citrus fruit or juice with an iron-fortified cereal, add tomatoes or bell peppers to your spinach salad, or drink a glass of OJ with your iron supplement. Avoid drinking tea or coffee with high-iron meals – polyphenols in them inhibit iron absorption (have your coffee an hour before or after breakfast, not with an iron-fortified cereal). Similarly, calcium supplements or dairy taken at the same time can reduce iron uptake (space them apart).

**Supplements:** If you’re iron-deficient (especially anemic), diet alone may not be enough to quickly restore levels. In that case, an iron supplement (ferrous sulfate or bisglycinate) under medical guidance is recommended. Typical dosing is ~65 mg elemental iron (325 mg ferrous sulfate) once daily – taken with vitamin C and not near high-calcium foods for best absorption. Be aware iron pills can cause GI upset or constipation in some; starting slow or trying different forms can help. **Do NOT supplement iron without confirmed deficiency**, as excess iron can be harmful (and doesn’t boost performance if you already have normal levels). For most, **prevention via diet** is key: many female runners take a low-dose iron multi or use iron-rich eating strategies proactively. *Elite note:* Many elite women and some men take periodic low-dose iron or an iron IV if levels drop dangerously, as keeping ferritin (iron stores) in a good range (~30–50 µg/L or higher) is crucial to sustain high training loads. 

**Bottom line:** **Keep iron levels up!** Eat iron-rich foods regularly, especially if you’re a menstruating female or vegetarian. If you notice persistent fatigue or drop in performance, get a blood test (ferritin, hemoglobin). Correcting an iron deficiency can dramatically improve energy and race times. Both elites and recreational runners should treat iron as a priority micronutrient – it’s the difference between your blood being a Ferrari or a sputtering jalopy. 

### 2.2 Magnesium – Muscle Function and Recovery  
**Why:** **Magnesium (Mg)** is involved in 300+ enzymatic reactions, including energy production (synthesis of ATP) and muscle contraction/relaxation. It’s crucial for **muscle and nerve function** – low magnesium can cause muscle cramps, twitching, or premature fatigue. It also contributes to bone health (works with calcium/vitamin D) and supports immune function. Endurance athletes lose magnesium through sweat and urine, and intense exercise may increase magnesium requirements by 10–20%. Suboptimal magnesium is surprisingly common (many diets don’t meet the RDA), and even a mild deficiency can impair exercise capacity and increase the stress response to training.

**Signs of low Mg:** Frequent muscle cramps or spasms (especially at night), excessive soreness, poor sleep, and elevated heart rate for a given effort can hint at magnesium inadequacy. 

**Needs:** Adult men ~400–420 mg/day, women ~310–320 mg/day. Athletes might aim for the upper end (e.g. female at ~320+ mg, male ~420+ mg). **Focus on Mg-rich foods**:
- **Nuts and seeds:** Almonds (~80 mg per 1 oz/23 almonds), cashews (~75 mg/oz), peanuts (~50 mg/oz), pumpkin seeds (~150 mg/oz). A daily handful of nuts goes a long way.
- **Whole grains:** Brown rice (~40 mg per cup cooked), oatmeal (~60 mg per cup dry), quinoa (~120 mg per cup cooked), whole wheat bread (~25 mg per 2 slices). Refined grains have less (magnesium is in the germ/bran).
- **Legumes:** Black beans (~120 mg per cup cooked), lentils (~70 mg/cup), edamame (~100 mg/cup).
- **Leafy greens:** Spinach (~150 mg per 1 cup cooked), Swiss chard (~150 mg per cup cooked). Even raw greens in salads contribute (3 cups raw spinach ~50 mg).
- **Others:** Bananas (~32 mg each), avocados (~58 mg each), dark chocolate (~65 mg per 1 oz 70% cacao). Yogurt and milk have ~30–40 mg per cup.

**Ensure intake:** Marathoners should include at least a couple of these foods daily. For instance, a sample day that meets magnesium:
- Breakfast: Oatmeal (1/2 cup dry ~30 mg) with 2 Tbsp almonds (~40 mg) and a banana (~32 mg). (~100+ mg total)
- Snack: 1 oz trail mix of cashews/pumpkin seeds (~100 mg).
- Lunch: Quinoa salad (1 cup quinoa ~120 mg, plus veggies ~20 mg). (~140 mg)
- Dinner: 1.5 cups cooked spinach (~225 mg) with salmon (fish has ~50 mg in a serving) and brown rice (~40 mg). (~315 mg)
- Total ~655 mg (above RDA, which is fine – the body excretes excess). This is an ideal day; hitting at least ~400–500 mg regularly would be great.

If your diet is heavy on refined grains and low on veggies/nuts, you may fall short. In that case, consider a supplement. **Magnesium supplements** (e.g. magnesium citrate, glycinate, or malate – which are more absorbable than magnesium oxide) of ~200–400 mg can help. Taking it in the evening can aid muscle relaxation and sleep. *Elites* often include magnesium as part of a recovery or sleep regimen, especially during heavy training or in hot climates where sweat losses are big. *Recreational* runners experiencing lots of cramps might try a nightly 300 mg Mg supplement – many find it reduces cramp frequency (though hydration and sodium also play roles).

**Caution:** Too much at once can cause diarrhea – if supplementing, start with 100–200 mg and build up, or use slow-release forms. Also, magnesium is part of some sports drinks marketed for endurance (for example, “endurance formula” Gatorade includes a small amount). These aren’t high enough to meet RDA but contribute a bit during races.

**Performance connection:** While magnesium won’t “boost” performance above normal, it ensures you can perform at your best. Studies show marginal Mg deficiency leads to higher oxygen cost of exercise and quicker fatigue. Conversely, correcting a deficiency improves performance metrics (e.g. time to exhaustion). So, it’s about avoiding a hidden limiter. Marathoners put huge demands on muscles and heart – magnesium helps both work properly (it’s even used medically for arrhythmias and muscle spasms). Think of it as the “relaxation mineral” that prevents excessive muscle tightening.

**Key point:** **Don’t overlook magnesium.** Eat plenty of nuts, whole grains, and greens to meet needs, and consider supplements if needed (especially if you get muscle cramps). Ensuring adequate magnesium will support muscle function, efficient energy metabolism, and recovery (by controlling exercise-induced oxidative stress and inflammation). Both elites and recreational runners benefit – the difference is elites tend to proactively ensure they get enough (via dietitians or supplements), whereas recreational runners might not think about Mg until a problem arises. Better to be proactive: a well-rounded diet as described will likely cover it. 

### 2.3 Sodium (and Electrolytes) – Hydration and Muscle Contraction  
**Why:** **Sodium** is the chief electrolyte lost in sweat, and it’s crucial for **maintaining fluid balance and muscle contraction**. It works in tandem with potassium to generate electrical impulses for muscle and nerve function. During a marathon, heavy sweating without sodium replacement can lead to dehydration or even hyponatremia (low blood sodium) – which causes weakness, cramps, confusion, or worse. Proper sodium intake helps:
- Retain fluids (so you don’t just pee out all the water you drink).
- Prevent or delay muscle cramps (especially for “salty sweaters” who lose a lot of salt).
- Maintain blood volume and cardiac output in long races (dehydration thickens blood and strains the heart).
- Avoid hyponatremia in slower runners who might overdrink water – adding sodium prevents dangerous dilution.

**Needs:** Unlike other micros with static RDAs, sodium needs vary widely by sweat rate. A good approach is **individualized hydration with sodium**:
- **During runs >1–2 hours:** Consume **~300–600 mg of sodium per hour** (and ~0.4–0.8 liters of fluid per hour, adjusting to thirst and conditions). This can come from sports drinks (which typically have ~200–300 mg per 8 oz), electrolyte capsules, or salty snacks. For example, if you drink ~16 oz Gatorade Endurance (~450 mg Na) each hour and take an electrolyte chew with 50 mg, that’s ~500 mg/hour – within range. Faster elites often have higher sweat rates and thus aim for the upper end (~600+ mg/hr), whereas a smaller recreational runner in cool weather might be fine at 300 mg/hr. 
- **Daily diet:** Marathoners should *not* follow ultra low-sodium diets – you need to replace what you sweat out. The general guideline for the public is <2300 mg/day, but athletes often can go higher, especially on big training days or in hot climates. A good strategy: **salt your food to taste** (your body often tells you how much). If you crave salt, eat something salty. Many runners naturally eat pickles, pretzels, soups, tomato juice, etc., after long runs because the body is seeking sodium. That’s fine. Aim at least for the recommended 1500 mg minimum, and more if you have high sweat losses (2,000–3,000+ mg on long run days is not unreasonable).
- **Pre-hydration:** In the day before and morning of the marathon, include some salty foods or an electrolyte drink to ensure you start with normal-high sodium levels. *E.g.* have broth-based soup or add soy sauce to your carb-rich pre-race dinner; drink 500 ml of a sports drink the night before; on race morning, have a sports drink with breakfast or a salt tablet (~300–500 mg) if you’re a heavy sweater. This helps you retain fluids better and reduces risk of hyponatremia from overdrinking plain water.

**Potassium:** Another key electrolyte (lost less in sweat than sodium). It’s vital for muscle cell function and heart rhythm. The good news: if you eat fruits and veggies liberally, you likely meet the potassium goal (~4700 mg). Oranges, bananas, potatoes, tomato sauce, coconut water, and yogurt are rich in K. Marathoners often naturally get potassium via their high-carb diet (bananas, OJ, tomato sauce on pasta). Just don’t cut out produce entirely, even during carb-load – opt for low-fiber but potassium-rich choices (like fruit juices, boiled potatoes without skin, bananas). Potassium works with sodium to prevent cramps and maintain performance, so both matter. But **replacing sodium is more urgent during the race** because K largely stays inside cells and isn’t as easily diluted as sodium.

**Magnesium & Calcium:** Already covered – both are electrolytes in a sense (Mg in muscle, Ca for muscle contraction). Ensure those are adequate through diet/supplements so that electrolyte balance is overall good. Calcium needs (~1000 mg/day) should be met for bone health and muscle function; low calcium can contribute to cramping and risk of stress fractures. Get calcium from dairy or fortified plant milks, and vitamin D (1000–2000 IU/day if not much sun) to absorb it – especially crucial for female marathoners to prevent bone density issues.

**Elites vs Recreational (Sodium):** 
- **Elites** sweat more (running at higher intensity generates more heat), but they also typically race in ~2–2.5 hours – so total sweat loss might be moderate. However, losing 3-4% body weight can impair performance, so elites have precise hydration plans. Many have personalized electrolyte mixes based on sweat testing (some lose >1000 mg Na/L of sweat, others <500 mg). They adjust their drinks accordingly. For example, an elite might drink 750 ml/hour of a 1000 mg/L sodium drink in a hot race to maintain output. They are also cautious to avoid overdrinking (carrying extra weight).
- **Recreational runners** (4–5+ hour finishers) face a dual risk: dehydration *and* hyponatremia (because they have more aid station opportunities and time to drink). It’s documented that slower marathoners are at higher risk of hyponatremia, especially if they only drink water. So recreational runners should **drink to thirst** and make sure *some* of that fluid has sodium – e.g. alternate water and sports drink. If you plan to only sip water, consider taking salt tabs (like ~300 mg every hour) to keep sodium in range. Many mid-pack runners cramp at mile 20 – sometimes due to sodium depletion as much as glycogen depletion. So including electrolytes can ward off those late-race cramps. 
- Overall, the advice of **300–600 mg Na/hr** holds for both, but an elite might be at 600+ mg for 2 hours (then done), and a recreational at ~400 mg for 5 hours (total more). *Individualize based on personal sweat rate*: if you finish long runs with salt crusts on your skin/clothes and often cramp, lean toward the high end of sodium replacement.

**Post-race rehydration:** After the marathon (or long training runs), replace both fluids and electrolytes. A rule of thumb is consume ~1.5 L fluid for each kg of body weight lost, with some sodium (e.g. ¼–½ tsp salt per liter or simply an electrolyte drink). If you only drink plain water after losing a lot of salt, you risk hyponatremia in recovery. So have a salty snack or drink. Brothy soup is fantastic post-marathon (rehydrates and provides sodium + carbs). 

**Key point:** **Manage your electrolytes, especially sodium, to optimize hydration and muscle function.** Practical tips:
- Include sodium in your pre-race meal (don’t eat completely salt-free).
- Use sports drinks or electrolyte caps during the race – don’t rely on water alone for anything over ~90 minutes.
- Listen to your body: salt cravings mean you likely need salt. Heavy sweat means replace salt. 
- Ensure overall diet includes sources of all electrolytes: e.g. a banana (potassium), nuts (magnesium), dairy (calcium), salted foods (sodium). 

By staying on top of electrolytes, you help maintain **blood volume**, **prevent cramping**, and **keep your nerves and muscles firing properly** through 26.2 miles. Both elites and recreational runners must respect electrolyte balance: elites to sustain high pace without overheating, recreational runners to avoid the medical tent from hyponatremia or severe cramps.

### 2.4 Other Notable Micronutrients  
- **Calcium & Vitamin D:** We touched on this above, but to reinforce: **Calcium** is critical for bone strength and muscle contraction. Marathoners (especially women) have a high incidence of stress fractures if diet is low in calcium or if they underfuel (low energy availability leads to bone loss). Get ~1000 mg Ca per day (roughly 3 servings of dairy or fortified alternatives). If you don’t eat dairy, get calcium-fortified plant milk, orange juice, tofu (if set with calcium sulfate), almonds, and green veggies (broccoli, kale have some). **Vitamin D** (actually a hormone) is needed to absorb calcium and for muscle function. Many runners training indoors or in winter are deficient (levels <30 ng/mL). A deficiency can reduce performance and increase injury risk. If sun exposure is limited, consider ~1000–2000 IU vitamin D3 daily (after checking your blood level). Many elites monitor vitamin D and take supplements if low; recreational runners in northern latitudes should too. Adequate D and calcium = stronger bones and better long-term durability. 
- **Zinc:** Important for immune function, healing, and energy metabolism. Runners lose zinc via sweat and might have higher needs (not fully established). RDA is ~8 mg women, 11 mg men. Meat and shellfish are top sources (6 oz beef ~7 mg, 6 oysters ~32 mg!). Plant sources (whole grains, seeds, legumes) have zinc but lower bioavailability. Vegetarians often benefit from 50% higher zinc intake to compensate (or a supplement). Mild zinc deficiency can manifest as frequent colds or slow wound healing. Most multis have zinc, so if you take one, you’re likely covered. 
- **B-Vitamins:** **B vitamins** (B1, B2, B3, B5, B6, B12, folate, biotin) are all involved in energy production and red blood cell synthesis. Marathoners have increased needs simply due to higher energy turnover. Generally, a varied diet with whole grains, lean meats, dairy, and vegetables/fruits supplies these. **B12** deserves special mention: it’s only in animal-derived foods, so vegetarians/vegans *must* get B12 from supplements or fortified foods. B12 and folate are needed to prevent anemia as well (they work with iron to form RBCs). Low B12 is common in older adults and strict vegetarians and can cause fatigue and neurological issues. Keep an eye on B12 (blood levels or just take a supplement – they’re safe). **Folate** is abundant in greens, beans, fortified grains. Marathoners, especially female, should ensure good folate intake (important if there’s any chance of pregnancy as well). B6 and B2 are in protein-rich foods and dairy/whole grains respectively – usually adequate if diet is balanced. In summary, **don’t skimp on whole grains and veggies** – they provide many B’s. If your diet is restrictive or you’re often tired, a B-complex or multi can fill gaps. 
- **Vitamin C:** Helps with iron absorption and is a key antioxidant supporting immune function and collagen formation. Marathon training can generate oxidative stress and temporarily dampen immunity (e.g. runners often catch colds after races). **Vitamin C** from fruits and vegetables (citrus, berries, kiwis, bell peppers, tomatoes, leafy greens) can mitigate that. Aim for at least ~200 mg/day (RDA 75–90 mg is minimal; many suggest ~200 mg for athletes). That’s like 1–2 oranges (70 mg each) plus a cup of strawberries (90 mg) – quite achievable. Studies show 200–1000 mg vitamin C daily may reduce the duration/severity of colds in athletes under heavy stress. So loading up on vitamin C–rich foods (or a moderate supplement, ~250 mg) in race week and recovery week is wise. But avoid megadoses (like 2000 mg daily for weeks) as that can interfere with training adaptation by neutralizing some signaling (small doses via food are fine and beneficial). 
- **Vitamin E & Selenium:** Both are antioxidants. **Vitamin E** is found in nuts, seeds, vegetable oils, wheat germ – a typical marathoner’s diet with nuts and peanut butter likely covers the ~15 mg/day (e.g. 1 oz almonds has ~7 mg, 2 Tbsp peanut butter ~3 mg). **Selenium** is in Brazil nuts (just 1 nut has over 70 mcg, which is the RDA!), seafood, whole grains. One Brazil nut a day or a serving of tuna a couple times a week covers selenium. These help quench free radicals from exercise. You don’t need extra beyond a balanced diet, but ensure you include these foods. 
- **Vitamin K:** Important for blood clotting and bone metabolism (works with vitamin D and calcium). Found in leafy greens (spinach, kale, etc.). If you eat salads or greens regularly, you’re fine. Just mentioning because some heavy carb-loaders neglect greens entirely – try to still include some (cooked if fiber is a concern) to get K and other micros. 
- **Choline:** Involved in metabolism and as a precursor for acetylcholine (neurotransmitter). Eggs and meat are great sources. Not usually an issue if you eat those. Vegetarians can get some from soy, beans, and cruciferous veg. 
- **Immune boosters:** Not a nutrient per se, but things like *probiotics* (yogurt, kefir, or supplement) and *glutamine* (an amino acid) are sometimes used by marathoners to support immunity during intense phases. Probiotics can improve gut health and possibly reduce GI issues and URTIs (upper respiratory tract infections). Including yogurt or fermented foods in your diet is a good idea. Glutamine, abundant in whey and meats, can be supplemented (~5 g) if you get ill often – mixed evidence, but some find it helpful after ultra races to boost immune cell function. 
- **Multi-vitamin/mineral supplement:** Many marathoners (elites and recreational alike) take a daily **multivitamin** as “insurance.” While not absolutely necessary if your diet is excellent, it can help cover any gaps (especially for micronutrients like zinc, selenium, iodine, which we often don’t think about). It’s recommended to choose a **basic RDA-level multi** (not mega-dose) from a reputable brand. This will typically provide 100% of most vitamins/minerals (including iron for women’s formulas, often none or low iron in men’s). Taking it with a meal enhances absorption. This won’t directly boost performance (if you’re not deficient, extra won’t make you “superhuman”), but it can prevent performance-harming deficiencies. **Elites** often prefer targeted supplements (they test and then supplement what they need – like iron, D, etc.), whereas **recreational** runners may not do regular bloodwork, so a multi ensures baseline adequacy. 

**Key point:** **Cover your micronutrient bases for health and performance.** Eat a varied diet rich in vegetables, fruits, whole grains, lean proteins, and dairy/fortified alternatives:
- Make sure to get **iron** (red meat, leafy greens + vitamin C) to avoid anemia.
- Include **calcium and vitamin D** (dairy or fortified plant milk, sunshine or supplement) for bones.
- Eat your **greens, beans, and nuts** for magnesium, potassium, vitamin K, etc.
- Enjoy a rainbow of fruits/veggies daily for vitamins C, A (beta-carotene), and antioxidants.
- If your diet is restrictive or you have known deficiencies, use supplements wisely to correct them.

Both elites and recreational runners need these micros – the difference is elites actively manage them with professional help (ensuring no low ferritin, etc.), whereas recreational runners should educate themselves to do the same. A deficiency can affect anyone, and it will slow you down. As one sports nutritionist mantra goes: *“You can’t fire on all cylinders if a spark plug (micronutrient) is missing.”*

## 3. Evidence-Based Supplements for Marathon Performance

Beyond a solid diet, certain **supplements with strong scientific backing** can enhance marathon training and racing. We focus on those with consensus evidence for endurance:

**Primary proven supplements:** 
- **Caffeine** – boosts endurance and mental focus.
- **Nitrate (Beetroot juice)** – improves exercise efficiency.
- **Carbohydrate supplements** (gels, drinks) – essentially “foods” but worth noting as race fuel (already covered under carbs).
- **Electrolytes (especially sodium)** – we covered under micros, but we'll reiterate usage in race context.
- **Creatine** – known for strength, but emerging benefits for endurance (finishing kick, recovery).
- **Beta-alanine** – buffers lactic acid, mostly for high-intensity efforts (minor role in marathon, but some use for final sprint or training).

**Secondary or situational supplements:** BCAAs, glutamine, collagen, and others can be beneficial in certain contexts (injury prevention, immune support) but have less direct impact on marathon performance – we’ll touch on them briefly.

Let’s delve into the key ones:

### 3.1 Caffeine – Boost Endurance and Alertness  
**Why:** **Caffeine** is one of the most effective and reliable performance enhancers for endurance sports. It acts on the central nervous system to reduce perceived exertion and fatigue, allowing you to maintain pace longer. It also improves alertness and mood, which helps with mental stamina in a marathon. Peripherally, caffeine mobilizes fatty acids (slightly sparing glycogen) and can increase calcium release in muscles (improving muscle fiber recruitment). The net effect is **improved endurance capacity and often faster race times**.

**Evidence:** Literally hundreds of studies. Meta-analyses show **3–6 mg/kg caffeine** can improve endurance performance by ~2–4% on average. Athletes go longer before exhaustion and can sustain higher intensities with caffeine. For marathoners, that could mean several minutes improvement or simply feeling stronger in the final 10K. It's beneficial for both elites and recreational runners. (It’s also legal – removed from WADA banned list; just don’t go crazy with dosage.)

**How to use:**
- **Dose:** ~3–6 mg per kg body weight. For a 60 kg runner, ~180–360 mg. For 80 kg, ~240–480 mg. Taking >6 mg/kg usually adds jitters without performance gain. Many find ~3–4 mg/kg just right (e.g. 200 mg for a ~150 lb person). If you’re caffeine-naïve (rare these days), even 2 mg/kg can help.
- **Timing:** **60 minutes pre-race** is ideal for caffeine to peak in your system. So if race start is 7:00, consume caffeine ~6:00. It can be as coffee, tea, an energy drink, or a pill. Find what works for your stomach. Coffee provides ~100 mg per small cup (8 oz) up to ~200+ mg for large brew (16 oz). Caffeine pills (like NoDoz, 200 mg each) offer a controlled dose. Many elites prefer taking it in a pill or gum form to know the mg precisely, whereas recreational runners often use their normal coffee routine. Do what you practiced.
- **During race:** **“Topping up”** caffeine mid-race can help, especially for longer races (3+ hours) as levels may drop. Common strategy: take a caffeinated gel (~20–40 mg) at the halfway or 30K mark, and/or another in the final 5K. Also, **caffeine gum** or chews (like Run Gum, caffeinated jelly beans) can be used at mile 20 for a quick hit (caffeine can absorb through mouth lining faster than through gut). Keep total intake within reason – e.g. if you had 200 mg pre-race and then two 50 mg gels, that’s 300 mg total, which is moderate for most adults. **Don’t exceed ~9 mg/kg** in total as that’s likely counterproductive and can cause side effects.
- **Habituation:** Good news – regular caffeine consumers still get performance benefits. You don’t need to quit coffee for weeks (which could cause withdrawal headaches during taper – not fun). Some evidence suggests the improvement might be slightly less in heavy daily users, but it’s still significant. If you want, you can reduce caffeine use the week before to heighten effect (some elites do a 3–7 day caffeine taper), but it’s not strictly necessary. Do what keeps you feeling normal in race week. Often just that pre-race dose plus maybe slightly less coffee in the days prior (so you’re not desensitized) works well. 
- **Precautions:** Practice caffeine use in training to gauge tolerance. Some runners experience GI upset (coffee can stimulate bowel movements – which is desired pre-race to an extent, but not during race). If coffee makes you urgently need the bathroom, maybe use a caffeine pill or energy drink pre-race instead (less volume). If you get very jittery or anxious on caffeine, opt for a lower dose (maybe 2 mg/kg). Caffeine can also elevate heart rate slightly and give a sense of **“amping up”** – helpful for motivation, but be sure to control your early-race pacing; don’t let the caffeine rush make you bolt out too fast. Pay attention to hydration as caffeine is a mild diuretic at rest (though not so much during exercise) – basically, don’t ignore thirst thinking “caffeine will dehydrate me” (that’s a myth; you still need to drink normally, caffeine doesn’t cause major dehydration during exercise). 
- **Elite vs Recreational:** Virtually all **elite marathoners use caffeine** unless they have a specific sensitivity. They’ve integrated it into their routine (often a strong coffee ~1–1.5 h before gun, plus maybe caffeinated gels). They do this because at their level a 1–2% boost could mean podium vs. off the podium. **Recreational runners** can benefit just as much – sometimes even more, as they might feel the mental boost strongly. Many recreational runners already rely on coffee to wake up for early runs, so including it on race day is natural and beneficial. If someone doesn’t consume caffeine normally, they can still use a small dose on race day and likely see a good effect, but absolutely **trial it** on a long run first to avoid surprises. 
- **Safety:** Caffeine is safe in moderate amounts. Very high doses (>600–800 mg in a short time) can cause palpitations or panic in susceptible individuals. Staying in the recommended range avoids that. Also, some people are slow metabolizers of caffeine (due to genetics) – they may get prolonged effects or sleep issues from even moderate doses. Know thyself – if a cup of coffee in the morning ruins your sleep at night, be careful with afternoon caffeine in racing (though marathons are usually morning events). 
- **Other forms:** Guarana (in some energy gels) is just a natural caffeine source. “Pre-workout” powders often contain caffeine plus other stuff – they can be used as a caffeine source but beware extra ingredients (some have too many stimulants). Probably simpler to stick to coffee or caffeine pill/gum for known dosage.  

**Key point:** **Caffeine is a proven, effective tool to enhance marathon performance**. Use it strategically: take ~3–4 mg/kg about an hour before the race, and consider a small additional dose late in the race via gels or chews. It will help you perceive less pain and effort, maintain focus, and possibly mobilize a bit more fat for fuel (saving carbs for later). Ensure you’ve practiced and that you manage any GI or pacing side effects. When used correctly, caffeine can be that extra gear in the final miles when you need it most.

### 3.2 Nitrates (Beetroot Juice) – “Nitric Oxide Boost” for Efficiency  
**Why:** **Dietary nitrates**, typically taken as **beetroot juice**, increase production of nitric oxide (NO) in the body. NO dilates blood vessels (improving oxygen delivery to muscles) and enhances mitochondrial efficiency (so you use oxygen more effectively to produce ATP). The result is **improved running economy** – your muscles require slightly less oxygen at a given pace. Studies show nitrates can reduce the O₂ cost of exercise and often improve time-to-exhaustion and time-trial performance in endurance events. 

**Evidence:** In trained cyclists and runners, beetroot juice supplementation has led to ~1–3% improvements in performance in events lasting 5–30 minutes. For longer events (marathons), results are mixed but generally positive: many athletes report they feel “easier” at marathon pace after beet juice, and some studies on longer time trials show small gains. Notably, nitrates seem to benefit **less elite athletes more strongly** (because elites are already very efficient) ([
            Nutrition and Supplement Update for the Endurance Athlete: Review and Recommendations - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6628334/#:~:text=can%20improve%20muscle%20economy%2C%20efficiency,12%20%2C%2072%2C52%20%2C%2074)). So recreational runners could see meaningful improvement (a couple minutes in a marathon) from nitrates, whereas elites might see smaller gains (but still helpful in a competitive field) ([
            Nutrition and Supplement Update for the Endurance Athlete: Review and Recommendations - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6628334/#:~:text=can%20improve%20muscle%20economy%2C%20efficiency,elite%20athletes%29%20%5B12%2C51%2C52%2C53)).

**How to use:**
- **Dose:** ~6–8 mmol of nitrate (≈500 ml (~17 oz) of beetroot juice or one concentrated “beet shot” product) is the standard acute dose. Some protocols use ~2 shots (≈12 mmol) for loading. Many products specify nitrate content – e.g. one Beet-It Sport shot contains ~400 mg nitrate (≈6.4 mmol). 
- **Timing:** **2–3 hours pre-race**. Nitrates are converted to nitrite by oral bacteria, then to NO in gut and blood – this process peaks ~2–3 hours after ingestion ([
            Nutrition and Supplement Update for the Endurance Athlete: Review and Recommendations - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6628334/#:~:text=results,suboptimal%20time%20interval%20for%20exercise)). Plan to consume beet juice ~2.5 hours before the start (so that by the time you’re an hour into the race, NO is peaking). Avoid using antiseptic mouthwash or gum after drinking it, as that kills the bacteria needed to convert nitrate to nitrite. 
- **Loading:** For a bigger effect, some do a **loading phase: 3 days of high nitrate intake** before the race. For example, drink one beet shot (~6 mmol) each day for 3 days, plus one on race morning. Studies found multi-day supplementation can increase muscle nitrate stores and perhaps yield more consistent improvements. Elites often do this to maximize any advantage; recreational runners could too, but even a single dose on race day helps.
- **Food alternatives:** If you can’t get beet juice, you can eat high-nitrate foods (spinach, arugula, celery, lettuce, beets). For instance, an **arugula salad** and **beet smoothie** the night before, and a **cup of beet juice** morning of, provides a lot of nitrate. But beet juice concentrates are easiest to get adequate dose without fiber/filling bulk.
- **Practice in training:** Try beet juice before a hard long run or tempo to see how your stomach handles it (and any taste issues). Some get mild GI upset; often mitigated by taking it with a bit of food and not chugging on an empty stomach. Also note, beet juice can cause **red/pink urine or stool** (“beeturia”) – harmless but don’t be alarmed (and don’t confuse it with blood). 
- **Safety:** Nitrates from veggies are safe (the old concerns about nitrates causing cancer applied to processed meats with nitrites plus high heat; veggie nitrates are considered benign and beneficial). People on blood pressure medication should be cautious since nitrates lower blood pressure slightly. If you have naturally low BP, ensure you hydrate well (the drop is usually small though). 
- **Elite vs Recreational:** **Elites**: Many use beet juice as part of race prep (some even drink it daily). It’s legal and increasingly common. They might not *feel* a huge difference but trust the science that it makes them more efficient (which can be the difference in a 2-hour race). **Recreational**: Could potentially feel an obvious difference (“my pace felt easier than usual”) because their baseline economy isn’t as optimized. They should definitely consider it – it’s basically like drinking a vegetable juice that could help performance. It also might help at the end when normally form breaks down – if muscles are a bit more oxygen-efficient, you may maintain form a bit longer.

**Key point:** **Nitrate supplementation (via beetroot juice) is a proven, safe way to boost endurance by improving how efficiently your body uses oxygen.** For marathoners, it’s another tool to marginally enhance performance, especially helpful for those not at the very pinnacle of efficiency (i.e. most recreational runners). To use it:
- Take ~500 ml beet juice or a concentrated beet shot ~2 hours before the race.
- Optionally, start 2–3 days out with a daily dose to saturate your system.
- Continue eating your usual carbs – beet juice complements, not replaces, your fueling.
- Don’t kill the mouth bacteria (no strong mouthwash).
- Enjoy the subtle edge: you might find you can hold goal pace with slightly less strain on race day – a gift in those final miles.

### 3.3 Creatine – A Strong Finish and Enhanced Training  
**Why:** **Creatine monohydrate** is famous for building strength in gym settings, but it has some benefits for endurance:
- **Finish-line sprint & surges:** Creatine increases phosphocreatine stores in muscle, which can improve performance in short, high-intensity bursts ([
            Creatine supplementation and endurance performance: surges and sprints to win the race - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10132248/#:~:text=effects%2C%20particularly%20in%20weight,mixed%3B%20however%2C%20creatine%20supplementation%20appears)). In a marathon, that might mean a more powerful finishing kick or the ability to surge uphill or pass a competitor without tying up as quickly.
- **Glycogen storage and recovery:** Creatine supplementation has been shown to **enhance glycogen loading** (it draws water and possibly glucose into muscles). One study found athletes who loaded creatine then carb-loaded stored ~10% more glycogen than those who only carb-loaded. More glycogen = more fuel in the later miles. Also, creatine has cell-protective effects: it can reduce inflammation and muscle cell damage after exhaustive exercise ([
            Creatine supplementation and endurance performance: surges and sprints to win the race - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10132248/#:~:text=co,In%20contrast%2C%20creatine)). This could aid recovery between hard sessions.
- **Strength maintenance:** Marathon training can sometimes lead to muscle loss or decreased power (all that slow running can make you a bit “weak”). Creatine, combined with strength training, helps maintain or increase muscular strength and anaerobic capacity even during heavy aerobic training ([
            Creatine supplementation and endurance performance: surges and sprints to win the race - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10132248/#:~:text=effects%2C%20particularly%20in%20weight,mixed%3B%20however%2C%20creatine%20supplementation%20appears)). This translates to better running economy (a stronger musculoskeletal system yields better form) and resilience (lower injury risk).
- **Cognitive benefits:** Some evidence suggests creatine can reduce mental fatigue (the brain also uses phosphocreatine). In ultra-endurance events, creatine has improved cognitive task performance post-exercise. In a marathon, this might not be noticeable, but any help to mental sharpness in the later stages is a plus.

**Drawbacks:** Creatine typically causes **1–2 kg water weight gain** in the first week of use (by drawing water into muscles). For runners, extra weight can slightly offset the benefits by increasing energy cost ~1–2%. This is why some avoid it. However, strategies exist to minimize weight gain:
- Use a **low-dose regimen**: e.g. 3 g/day for 3–4 weeks (instead of a rapid 20 g/day load) – this still saturates muscles with less sudden water retention.
- **Cycle it in training**: Use creatine in base or during heavy training (to get recovery and training benefits), then stop a couple weeks before the race to lose any extra water. Muscle creatine remains elevated ~4–6 weeks after stopping, so you might retain some benefit into race day with reduced weight. 
- Accept a small weight gain if the net effect is positive – e.g. if you gain 1 kg but your sprint at the end is significantly better, that trade-off may be worth it, especially for recreational runners for whom a couple minutes matter for PR but not podium (though it can matter for Boston qualifying, etc.).

**Evidence:** Creatine doesn’t directly improve VO₂max or steady-state endurance. Studies on creatine in marathon-like scenarios are limited. However, a review noted creatine **consistently improves high-intensity work capacity** during endurance exercise (like end-spurts or repeat surges) ([
            Creatine supplementation and endurance performance: surges and sprints to win the race - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10132248/#:~:text=effects%2C%20particularly%20in%20weight,mixed%3B%20however%2C%20creatine%20supplementation%20appears)). E.g., cyclists on creatine performed better in final sprints after a prolonged ride. Another study found 5k times weren’t hurt by creatine despite weight gain, and those runners had better finishing kick. So, think of creatine as a means to **improve quality of your training (intervals, hill workouts)** and give you a bit more explosiveness when needed, without harming endurance (aside from carrying some water weight).

**Who might use it:**
- **Elite marathoners** who anticipate tactical surges or a sprint finish might experiment with creatine in training to help with those demands. Many elite track runners (1500m/5k) use creatine for power; some marathoners might in preparation if they value power (though some avoid due to weight – it’s a personal call). Elites also might use it if they incorporate heavy weight training to boost strength for economy. 
- **Recreational runners** can use creatine to support their training load – e.g. doing creatine while building speed in the off-season, to gain some muscle that helps protect joints. If a recreational runner often fades at the end or struggles with running form in the last 10k (due to muscle fatigue), creatine could potentially help by maintaining muscle energy. It’s more commonly used by marathoners who cross over from triathlons or those who just want every possible advantage. 

**Dosage & Use:** Standard loading: 20 g/day (split into 4 doses) for 5–7 days, then 3–5 g/day maintenance. To minimize GI upset, take with meals and plenty of water. Alternatively, skip loading and go straight to 3–5 g/day for 4 weeks (you’ll reach saturation by then). Ensure you stay well-hydrated (since creatine draws water into cells). Time of day doesn’t matter much, but taking it post-workout with carbs/protein can slightly improve uptake. 
- If using tactically: consider using creatine in training (for benefits in building strength/speed), then **taper off before the race** to shed water. Stop about 4 weeks out – you’ll lose any water weight in 1–2 weeks, but your muscles will stay loaded for a few weeks. 
- If you decide to keep using through race, just know you might be a bit heavier – plan pacing accordingly if needed (though ~1% weight likely won’t drastically affect your pace if you’ve trained with it).
- Always test in training – creatine is safe (the most studied supplement), but a minority get mild stomach upset or feel “puffy”. See how you react.

**Key point:** **Creatine can aid marathoners by improving high-intensity capacity and recovery, but it can cause slight water weight gain.** If you incorporate intervals and gym work, creatine can heighten those training benefits, which indirectly improves marathon performance. It can also give you confidence that you have a powerful gear if needed in the race. It's not a must-have for everyone – prioritize carbs/caffeine/nitrates first – but for those looking for marginal gains, creatine is an option. 

### 3.4 Beta-Alanine – Buffering the Burn  
**Why:** **Beta-alanine** is an amino acid that raises muscle **carnosine** levels (the body’s natural acid buffer). More carnosine = better **buffering of hydrogen ions (H+)**, delaying the drop in pH that causes that burning, fatiguing sensation in muscles during intense exercise. This is clearly beneficial for events like the 800m or 1500m. For a marathon, you ideally avoid accumulating lots of lactate except in maybe the final push or on big hills. So beta-alanine’s direct effect on marathon pacing is minor – you typically race below the lactate threshold. However, consider:
- In the **final mile or sprint**, when you kick, beta-alanine might help you go a few seconds faster or with less distress (because it buffers the sudden spike in acidity).
- During **training**, beta-alanine could allow slightly more intense tempo runs or hard finish long runs by buffering the lactate that creeps in.
- Many marathoners do some shorter races (5Ks, 10Ks) or high-intensity intervals as part of training – beta-alanine would help significantly in those workouts, which can improve your overall fitness and speed reserve. 
- There’s some research indicating beta-alanine might improve exercise capacity in the presence of acidosis – e.g. one study found cyclists with beta-alanine could finish a set of hard intervals with greater total work done. That could translate to better quality training for a marathoner. 
- Overall, think of beta-alanine as a tool to **push your lactate threshold a bit higher**. A slightly higher threshold means you can hold a faster pace without accumulating fatigue byproducts – useful in a marathon to maybe sustain a stronger pace before fatigue sets in.

**Evidence:** Beta-alanine consistently improves performance in 1–10 minute maximal efforts by ~2–3% in recreational athletes (less in elites, ~1%). For longer efforts, evidence is mixed – some studies show small improvements in endurance performance, others no significant change. One study on a 10km run found beta-alanine users finished with lower blood lactate, implying they handled the effort more aerobically (which could mean feeling better at the end). Marathon-specific research is scant. But since a marathon is mostly aerobic, don’t expect a big direct boost – maybe a slight benefit in the final stretch or in how strong you feel at lactate threshold (like late-race when you might start creeping over threshold).

**Use:** Beta-alanine must be **loaded**: ~4–6 g/day split into 2–3 doses for at least 4 weeks. You need to start supplementing well ahead of your race (e.g. at the beginning of a 12-week training cycle) to raise muscle carnosine. Keep taking it through training; you can stop a week or two before race (carnosine remains elevated for a while). Side effect: **tingling/paresthesia** if you take too much at once. To avoid that, take smaller doses (e.g. 1.6 g x 3 times daily) or use sustained-release capsules. It’s safe and not banned. 
- Many athletes pair beta-alanine with creatine and caffeine in a “stack” (e.g. a lot of pre-workout supplements contain both). They work via different mechanisms, so they can be complementary (creatine helps sprint energy, beta-alanine helps buffer acid, caffeine helps CNS).
- It’s relatively inexpensive, so some recreational runners try it as part of their supplement regimen. 

**Is it worth it for marathons?** It’s not the first priority, because marathoners are usually limited by fuel/hydration or muscular endurance, not by lactic acid buildup. However, if you are doing everything else right (diet, training, other key supplements) and want an extra edge, beta-alanine is one of the few legal supplements proven to affect fatigue resistance. If you do a lot of threshold training, it may help you push your threshold pace slightly (some studies on rowers showed improved lactate threshold with BA). Also, if you just like to race shorter events too, BA will help those and might indirectly improve your marathon by making your 5K/10K speed better (thus improving speed reserve).

**Elite vs Recreational:** **Elites** may use beta-alanine if they also compete in track or half-marathons where it’s more relevant. Some may take it as part of an overall approach (especially if they have a strong finishing kick as part of their strategy, any buffering helps). **Recreational** runners probably benefit less because they seldom approach anaerobic limits in a marathon (their pace is farther below threshold relative to elites). But they might benefit in training or shorter tune-up races. The meta-analysis suggests recreational athletes see a larger relative improvement from BA in general (since they have lower baseline buffering capacity). So a recreational runner could see maybe a little more help than an elite would, in high-intensity parts.

**Key point:** **Beta-alanine is a low-priority but potentially useful supplement for marathoners**, mainly for **improving high-intensity efforts (in training or final sprint) and raising lactate threshold**. It should be viewed as complementary to the main endurance boosters. If you choose to use it, commit to loading it daily for weeks – it’s not an acute aid. It won’t do much for most of the race, but it might help you finish stronger or handle mid-race surges better. If budget or discipline for taking daily supplements is an issue, you can skip beta-alanine and focus on the bigger rocks (carbs, fluid, caffeine, etc.). It's more of a fine-tuning supplement. 

### 3.5 Other Supplements (Quick Hits)
- **Branched-Chain Amino Acids (BCAAs):** These are leucine, isoleucine, and valine – amino acids that can be used by muscles and may reduce central fatigue by competing with tryptophan uptake in the brain. Some marathoners take BCAA during long runs (via powder in drinks or capsules) hoping to delay fatigue or reduce post-run soreness. The evidence is mixed – some small studies show reduced RPE (rating of perceived exertion) or less muscle damage, others show no effect. If you’re consuming protein after runs and eating enough overall, you likely get plenty of BCAAs (particularly leucine) – additional BCAA during the race probably doesn’t significantly improve performance. They won’t harm, and might help you feel a bit better (some athletes subjectively feel they perk up with BCAAs in an ultra). But for a marathon, most benefit comes from actual carbs and an overall good protein intake, not isolated BCAAs. 
- **Glutamine:** An amino acid thought to support the immune system and gut integrity. Hard exercise can lower blood glutamine temporarily, which some hypothesize contributes to post-marathon immunosuppression. Some athletes take ~5–10 g glutamine powder after races or intense training blocks. A few studies suggested it might reduce infections in endurance athletes (though not strongly conclusive). It doesn’t directly improve performance acutely, but as a recovery aid it might help some individuals. It’s safe (glutamine is abundant in food proteins and body tissue). If you often get sick in heavy training, glutamine (along with ensuring carbs and protein) could be worth a try. 
- **Antioxidants:** We covered C and E. Athletes sometimes also supplement things like **N-acetylcysteine (NAC)** to bolster glutathione (an internal antioxidant) or **polyphenols** like quercetin. There’s some evidence high-dose quercetin (1000 mg/d) can increase VO₂max slightly and reduce illness in athletes, but results are mixed and practical effect is small. Better to get polyphenols via diet (berries, cherries, green tea). NAC has shown a bit of promise in buffering oxidative stress and even in improving endurance in some studies (by aiding blood flow/NO production), but it’s not mainstream; it requires dosage timing and can cause nausea. Most rec runners don’t need to go down that rabbit hole – focusing on fruit/veg intake covers antioxidant needs.
- **Collagen/Gelatin + Vitamin C:** Not for performance per se, but to **support tendons/joints**. Some evidence suggests taking ~5–15 g gelatin or collagen with ~50 mg vitamin C an hour before a short bout of jump rope or easy exercise can increase collagen synthesis in tendons/ligaments. Some elite runners do this as a preventive measure for injury. If you have tendon issues (like Achilles niggles), this protocol (pioneered by Keith Baar’s research) might help strengthen those tissues over time. It’s more in the realm of injury management than performance, but healthy tendons mean consistent training, which definitely affects performance. 
- **Probiotics:** A healthy gut can impact nutrient absorption and immunity. Probiotic supplements (with strains like Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium) have been shown in some athlete studies to reduce GI distress during competitions and lower the incidence of URTIs (colds). Marathoners who have a “nervous stomach” before races or antibiotic use in training might consider a daily probiotic. It’s no performance boost on race day, but it could mean not having to sprint to the porta-potty mid-race (which *does* impact performance!). Also, some research shows certain probiotic strains may increase time to fatigue by enhancing carbohydrate metabolism – it’s early research but interesting. 
- **Sodium Phosphate:** A lesser-known supplement that can increase 2,3-DPG in red blood cells and improve VO₂max. Loading with sodium phosphate (~1 g, 4x/day for 3 days) has shown ~3–5% improvements in VO₂max and time-trial performance in some studies. It was somewhat popular in the 90s/00s among elites. It can cause GI upset for some, and evidence is mixed but generally positive. If someone has the means and interest, it’s legal and relatively safe (phosphate is found in foods). It’s not widely used now but is an option for those chasing every edge. 
- **Glycerol:** Historically used to hyperhydrate (no longer banned by WADA as of 2018). Taking glycerol with water pre-race can increase body water. Could help in heat by delaying dehydration. But dosing is tricky (0.5–1 g/kg glycerol with 1.5 L+ water over an hour) and can cause headaches or bloating. Most athletes now rely on simpler methods (like salt + adequate drinking + slushie ice drinks) for heat prep. Recreational runners need not bother with glycerol – just drink to thirst and include electrolytes.
- **Tart Cherry Juice:** Many runners drink tart cherry concentrate after races to speed recovery – it’s rich in anthocyanin antioxidants and has been shown to reduce muscle soreness and strength loss post-marathon. E.g. 8–12 oz tart cherry juice daily for 4–5 days around the race. Not a performance enhancer during the race, but can get you back to training quicker after.
- **Ashwagandha:** An adaptogenic herb that some studies (in untrained people) showed can improve VO₂max. One RCT found 600 mg/day ashwagandha extract for 8 weeks improved 12 min run distance in healthy adults. It might reduce stress and improve recovery. Small effect but some athletes use it for its anti-anxiety and potential endurance benefits. It's not core, but worth a mention. 
- **Thorne Multi-Vitamin Elite or other sports-specific multis:** Some companies make tailored vitamin packs with extra of what athletes need (like more B’s, antioxidants, adaptogens). These can be convenient. For example, Thorne’s AM/PM packs have things like green tea extract, coenzyme Q10, and cordyceps mushroom. The evidence on those extras is not strong but some athletes feel it helps energy and recovery. It’s an option if budget isn’t a concern – but not necessary.

**Important:** Always try any supplements in training first. And ensure any supplement you use is **third-party tested for sport** (NSF Certified for Sport, Informed Choice) to avoid contamination with banned substances (elites must heed this; rec runners should too for safety).

**Summary of supplements priorities:**
- **Tier 1 (Strong evidence for marathon):** Carbohydrate supplements (gels, drinks), Caffeine, Nitrates (Beetroot), Sodium/Electrolytes.
- **Tier 2 (Good evidence but situational):** Creatine ([

        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10132248/#:~:text=effects%2C%20particularly%20in%20weight,mixed%3B%20however%2C%20creatine%20supplementation%20appears)), Beta-Alanine, possibly Sodium Phosphate, BCAA (if diet protein is low during ultra events).
- **Tier 3 (Indirect or individual):** Multivitamins, Collagen (for injury prevention), Probiotics (for gut/immune health), Tart Cherry (for recovery), Adaptogens (like Ashwagandha, Rhodiola for perceived fatigue).
- **Avoid** anything not backed by science or potentially harmful (e.g. high-dose baking soda during a marathon – GI nightmare; or things like DMAA which are banned stimulants sometimes found in sketchy pre-workouts).

**Key point:** **Stick to supplements that are proven and that you’ve tested on yourself.** For most marathoners, a simple stack might be: *caffeine + beet juice pre-race, gels + electrolytes during, balanced diet + whey protein + multi-vitamin daily.* That covers nearly all bases. Elites might add a couple others (iron supplement if needed, creatine in training, maybe beta-alanine, etc.). Recreational runners should focus on the big wins: if you haven’t nailed carb fueling and hydration, fancy supplements won’t save you. But once you have, using caffeine, beetroot, and possibly creatine/beta-alanine can give you a minor but meaningful performance edge.

## 4. Ideal Food Examples and Timing (Training & Race Day)

This section ties the above recommendations into clear **meal and snack examples** for both training days and race day. We’ll illustrate:
- A sample **training day menu** for a marathoner (to show how macros and micros come from food).
- **Pre-race meal** examples (night-before dinner and race-morning breakfast for elite vs recreational).
- **During-race fuel** choices (what and when to consume).
- **Post-run recovery** meals/snacks. 

We’ll also point out any differences to consider for elite competitors vs. recreational runners.

### 4.1 Training Day – Sample Daily Meal Plan (Assume heavy training day with a morning run and afternoon cross-training)

**Runner:** 70 kg male, with a 14-mile AM run + 4-mile PM easy run (or cross-training). Needs ~3500 kcal, focusing on high carbs (~60% kcal), ~20% protein, ~20% fat.

- **6:00 AM – Pre-run snack (30–60 min before run):** 
  - 1 medium banana (≈27 g carbs, 0.5 g protein, 0g fat, rich in potassium) 
  - 1 tablespoon honey or jam (≈15 g carbs) 
  - 1 cup sports drink (e.g. Gatorade, ≈15 g carbs + 110 mg sodium)  
  *Carbs:* ~57 g. *Purpose:* Quick fuel to top off liver glycogen and maintain blood sugar during long run without overfilling stomach. Contains easy-to-digest carbs and a bit of sodium/fluid. **Elite tweak:** An elite might also add a caffeine source here (e.g. 8 oz coffee (~100 mg caffeine)). A recreational runner might skip the sports drink if run is <90 min, but for 14 miles it’s wise to take it. 

- **During 14-mile run (≈2 hours):** 
  - 2 gels (1 at 45 min, 1 at 90 min; each ~20 g carbs, some have 20–50 mg caffeine, 100 mg sodium each) 
  - Water from fountain or carried (approx 16 oz total)  
  *Carbs:* ~40 g + some electrolytes and fluid. *Purpose:* Practice race fueling – maintaining energy and hydration. **Elite vs Rec:** Both should fuel in long runs; an elite might take a bit more (e.g. 3 gels in 2 hours = 60 g/h since they may run faster and burn more) or use a higher-carb drink. Recreational might do 20–30 g/h if that’s all they tolerate at first and work up. 

- **9:00 AM – Post-run Recovery Breakfast (30 min after finish):** 
  - Large bowl of oatmeal (1 cup dry oats cooked in milk) (≈50 g carbs, 14 g protein, 8 g fat, magnesium and iron-rich) 
  - 2 tablespoons brown sugar or maple syrup (≈30 g carbs) 
  - 1 scoop whey protein (25 g protein) mixed into the oatmeal or in a shake on the side 
  - 1 cup orange juice (≈26 g carbs, 100% RDA vitamin C, plus potassium/folate)  
  *Macros:* ~106 g carbs, ~39 g protein, ~8 g fat. *Purpose:* Rapid glycogen replenishment (oats + sugar + OJ ~100+ g carbs) and muscle repair (whey + milk protein ~30–40 g). Also rehydration (milk + OJ fluids) and micronutrients (vitamin C aids iron absorption from oats, calcium from milk, etc.). **Elite vs Rec:** Both need this. The elite might add fruit (e.g. berries) for extra carbs and antioxidants, and perhaps skip whey if they prefer whole foods (milk + oats + maybe egg whites for protein). A recreational runner might not normally eat this much – but after a long run, appetite is usually high, so it's achievable. 

- **11:30 AM – Midday snack:** 
  - Trail mix: 1/4 cup almonds, 1/4 cup dried cranberries (≈20 g carbs, 6 g protein, 15 g fat; high vitamin E, magnesium from almonds; simple carbs from cranberries) 
  - 1 granola bar (≈25 g carbs, 3 g protein, 4 g fat; often fortified with B-vitamins and iron) 
  - Water or an electrolyte drink (if still catching up on hydration)  
  *Macros:* ~45 g carbs, ~9 g protein, ~19 g fat. *Purpose:* Provide additional calories to meet daily needs, healthy fats for inflammation control (nuts), some carbs to keep energy up for afternoon session, and some protein for ongoing recovery. Also adds micronutrients (almonds – magnesium; dried fruit – potassium; fortified bar – B-vitamins, iron). **Elite vs Rec:** Both could have a snack; an elite might have a slightly larger snack or two snacks (their kcal needs might be 4000–4500). A rec runner might have a smaller portion if less hungry, but given high miles, they should snack to avoid energy lows.

- **1:30 PM – Lunch:** 
  - Large turkey & cheese sandwich on whole-grain bread: 4 oz turkey breast (≈35 g protein, 0 g carb, 2 g fat, high in zinc and B12), 2 slices Swiss cheese (≈16 g protein, 0 g carb, 16 g fat, calcium), tomato and lettuce (adds vitamin C, K, minimal carbs), and 2 slices whole wheat bread (≈30 g carbs, 6 g protein, 2 g fat, B-vitamins, magnesium).  
  - Side of baby carrots (1 cup, ~10 g carbs, high vitamin A) and hummus (2 Tbsp, ~4 g carbs, 2 g protein, 4 g fat, some iron).  
  - 1 medium apple (≈25 g carbs, fiber, vitamin C).  
  - Water or a sports drink (to taste, maybe 8 oz low-cal sports drink for a bit of sodium).  
  *Macros:* ~65 g carbs, ~57 g protein, ~24 g fat. *Purpose:* Provide substantial protein for muscle repair midday, a moderate amount of carbs to restock from morning and fuel evening run (whole grains + fruit), and quality fats (cheese, hummus) for satiety and micronutrients. Also covers a lot of micros: high iron & zinc from turkey, calcium & vitamin D from cheese, vitamins A & K from carrots, etc. **Elite vs Rec:** Very similar. An elite might eat even more carbs here (e.g. add pretzels or have a bigger side like a cup of rice or pasta salad) since their absolute energy need is higher, and might trim some fat (maybe 1 slice cheese instead of 2) to prioritize carbs if needed. A recreational runner might be fine with this portion. Both get a dense mix of macros and micros. 

- **4:00 PM – Pre-afternoon run snack (if doing second session around 5:00 PM):** 
  - 1 packet of energy chews or half a sports drink (≈20 g carbs) 
  - Possibly a small coffee (for caffeine) or just water  
  *Purpose:* Quick carbs to top up energy for the easy 4-miler, and possibly a bit of caffeine to shake off midday doldrums (for an elite, second runs are often recovery pace so usually no caffeine needed; a recreational runner coming from work might want a small coffee). Light on stomach but preventing running on completely empty if lunch was 2+ hours ago. 

- **During 4-mile evening run:** Probably just water as needed – no fuel needed for <40-min easy run.

- **5:45 PM – Post-PM-run recovery (small):** 
  - 8 oz chocolate milk (≈30 g carbs, 8 g protein, 5 g fat, fluids/electrolytes)  
  *Purpose:* Kickstart recovery immediately with easily consumed combo of carbs+protein. Especially useful if dinner will be delayed. Chocolate milk is a proven recovery aid. **Elite vs Rec:** Both can use this. If dinner is right away, this might be skipped, but many like a little recovery snack. It also contributes to daily totals.

- **7:00 PM – Dinner:** 
  - Grilled salmon fillet, 6 oz (≈0 g carbs, 40 g protein, 12 g fat, rich in omega-3s and protein)  
  - Steamed white rice, 1.5 cups (≈70 g carbs, 6 g protein, 1 g fat – high GI, good for refilling glycogen at day’s end)  
  - Stir-fried mixed vegetables (bell peppers, broccoli, snow peas) in 1 Tbsp olive oil (≈10 g carbs from veggies, 0 g protein, 5 g fat from oil, lots of vitamins: C, K, folate, plus potassium and antioxidants)  
  - Soy sauce for flavor (adds ~1000 mg sodium – good to replenish salt from day’s sweat)  
  - 1 cup mixed fruit salad for dessert (melon, grapes, berries – ≈25 g carbs, rich in vitamin C and polyphenols)  
  *Macros:* ~105 g carbs, ~46 g protein, ~18 g fat. *Purpose:* Major carb reload to replenish muscle glycogen overnight (rice + fruit ~95 g carbs) and high-quality protein for overnight muscle repair (salmon). Also provides omega-3 fatty acids (anti-inflammatory for recovery) and a broad spectrum of micronutrients from veggies and fruits. Sodium in soy sauce helps recover sweat salt losses. **Elite vs Rec:** Both can follow a similar dinner outline. An elite might eat a larger portion of rice (2+ cups, 90+ g carbs) and/or have an extra carb like a dinner roll to hit very high carb targets on heavy days. A recreational runner could perhaps do 1 cup rice instead of 1.5 if they needed less calories. But generally, the composition (lean protein + carb base + veggies + healthy fat) is ideal for all. 

- **Bedtime (10:00 PM) – Optional snack:** 
  - If still hungry or in heavy training, could have 6 oz Greek yogurt with a spoon of honey (≈15 g carbs, 10 g protein, 0 fat) or a small handful of almonds and a few dates (carbs + healthy fat). 
  - Or simply a glass of milk.  
  *Purpose:* Provide extra protein (casein in dairy) to drip-feed muscles overnight and extra calories if needed to meet daily expenditure. Also, a bedtime snack can improve sleep in athletes who often go to bed hungry (which can disrupt sleep). Many elites have something light before bed for this reason. Recreational runners should listen to hunger cues – if you’re hungry, have a small balanced snack; if not, don’t force it. Ensure fluid needs are met (drink water to thirst in evening so you’re not dehydrated overnight). 

This sample day yields approximately: **~570–600 g carbs, ~180 g protein, ~90 g fat**, which for a 70 kg runner is ~8.5 g/kg carbs, 2.6 g/kg protein, 1.3 g/kg fat – consistent with heavy training recommendations (protein a bit above standard recommendation but many experts now advise endurance athletes 1.6–2.2 g/kg protein, so it’s fine and aids recovery). It’s ~4000 kcal, which might be a bit high for some 70 kg runners and just right for others depending on metabolism and run pace (this example is on the robust side to cover an elite’s needs; a recreational runner might trim portion sizes slightly to get ~3500 kcal). 

**Micronutrient coverage in this menu:**
- Iron: oatmeal, whole wheat, almonds, vegetables contribute non-heme; turkey, salmon contribute some heme. Plus fortified cereal bar. Probably around ~20 mg iron – decent for a male, for a female she might swap in some red meat or take a supplement.
- Calcium: milk in oatmeal (300 mg), cheese (200 mg), yogurt (200 mg), milk in chocolate milk (150 mg) – likely hit ~1000 mg.
- Sodium: Pretzels, sports drink, soy sauce – deliberate inclusion to replace sweat. Easily >3000 mg across day (which is fine given all the sweating).
- Magnesium: almonds, cashews, oatmeal, whole grains, leafy veg – likely around ~500+ mg total, which is great.
- Potassium: OJ, bananas, potatoes, melon, etc. – likely exceeding 4700 mg (1 banana ~400 mg, 1 cup OJ ~450 mg, carrots/broccoli ~300 mg, potato ~900 mg, etc.).
- Zinc: turkey and salmon, plus whole grains and almonds – likely close to or above 11 mg.
- Vitamin C: lots from OJ, fruits, peppers, broccoli – multiple times RDA, which is beneficial for collagen synthesis and immunity.
- B-vitamins: high from whole grains, meat, dairy – likely all met (especially due to fortified cereal bar).
- Vitamin D: salmon is a great source (~450 IU in 6 oz), plus dairy (if milk was fortified ~100 IU per cup) – might still be below 1000 IU total, so maybe an elite would take a D supplement to ensure ~2000 IU (recreational might too if blood levels are low).
- Omega-3: salmon (3–4 g EPA/DHA) + walnuts if had any – great for reducing exercise-induced inflammation. On non-fish days, an elite might take fish oil.
- Antioxidants: plentiful from fruits, veggies, also green tea if they drink (some elites do matcha/green tea for polyphenols). 

**Elite vs Recreational differences:** As seen, it’s largely portion sizes and fine tweaks. Both should have similar structure: **carb-centric meals with enough protein and color (produce).** Elites just eat more and might choose even lower fiber options when needed (to accommodate more carbs or reduce gut bulk pre-race). For example, an elite in peak week might do more white rice/bread instead of some whole grains to allow sheer volume of carbs without fiber fullness. Recreational runners might keep more whole grains because they aren’t force-feeding extreme carb quantities.

The big picture: **Eat consistently throughout the day**, **time nutrients around runs**, and **include variety** to cover micros. This supports heavy training, whether you’re running 50 miles/week or 100+.

### 4.2 Marathon Race Nutrition (Race Week & Race Day)

**Race Week Adjustments:** The final 5–7 days before a marathon, training load drops (taper), and nutrition focus shifts to maximizing glycogen and ensuring the gut is calm by race morning.

- **Carb-loading (last 2–3 days):** As covered, increase carbs to ~8–12 g/kg. In practice, **eat more carbs and slightly less fat/protein** than normal to avoid overstuffing calories. Replace some protein and fat portions with extra grains, sports drinks, and low-fiber sweets (like pretzels, jam, white bread). For example, if you normally have chicken and veggies for lunch, in carb-load you might have a larger portion of rice, a smaller piece of chicken, and skip the fibrous salad. Elites often do 70–80% carbs in these days; recreational runners should aim at least 60–70%. It’s okay to eat “processed” carbs now (e.g. plain bagels, corn flakes, etc.) since fiber and heavy starches can cause GI issues. Think **pasta, rice, bread, potatoes, fruit juice, bananas, low-fat cookies, sports drinks**. Keep familiar foods – don’t experiment with a giant plate of something you never eat. 
  - **Elite note:** Some elites do a short “depletion run” ~6–7 days out, then a 3-day super-compensation (the classic carbo-load method). Others just gradually taper up carbs as training tapers. Do whatever you practiced in tune-up races. If never tried depletion, don’t do it race week – just do a standard high-carb diet in final days.
  - **Recreational note:** Be careful not to **overeat total calories** in taper – you need high % carbs, but since training is less, you might not need as many calories as peak training. Focus on upping carbs and trimming portion sizes of fat/protein. It’s normal to gain ~2–4 lbs from water with glycogen – that means you successfully loaded. Don’t panic; that weight will fuel you on race day.

- **Taper micronutrients:** Keep iron-rich foods in early taper (if you supplement iron, continue up to race; some stop a day or two before to avoid GI side effects). Ensure good **vitamin C** daily (for immune health – taper often when people catch colds due to reduced cortisol from taper stress). Continue calcium/vit D if you take them (for bone maintenance – not directly impacting race, but good habit). Maybe emphasize antioxidant-rich fruits (berries, cherries) to assist muscle recovery from training. But avoid mega-doses of any one antioxidant (like don’t start taking 2000 mg vitamin C – it could blunt training adaptions right at the end). A balanced diet or a normal multi is fine. 
- **Avoid risky foods:** In final 48 hours, cut out high-risk foods for GI issues: very high fiber (huge salads, bran cereals), very spicy foods (that might cause heartburn or worse), and any foods you know upset you (some people avoid legumes, certain FODMAPs, or gas-formers like broccoli/cauliflower in last days). Also avoid excessive alcohol – a single beer or wine at 2 nights out is fine if it’s routine (some find it relaxes them), but heavy drinking will dehydrate you and disturb sleep – not worth it. Many skip alcohol entirely in last week to maximize recovery and ensure top sleep quality.
- **Hydration:** Drink plenty of fluids during taper, but **don’t overdrink plain water**. Include electrolytes (a sports drink or add a pinch of salt to water) so you don’t dilute sodium. Aim for pale yellow urine. In the 1–2 days pre-race, some runners do “hyper-hydration” with a product like Nuun or Skratch Hyper Hydration (high sodium mix) to boost fluid retention – can be useful in hot conditions. But often just drinking to thirst and ensuring some salty food is enough. 
- **Pre-race dinner (the night before):** Make it **carb-focused, moderate in protein, low in fat/fiber, and familiar**. Good options: 
  - Grilled chicken (small serving) with a big plate of pasta and a roll (classic “pasta party” meal). Use tomato sauce (not too much cheese or oil). Have a small dessert like sorbet or a low-fat muffin for extra carbs.
  - Lean beef or turkey with white rice (like a mild stir-fry with minimal oil, heavy on rice, light on meat/veg). Soy sauce for salt.
  - Pancakes or waffles even (breakfast for dinner) with syrup and a side of egg whites or low-fat yogurt – high carb and low fiber.
  - **Elite note:** Many elites eat early (6 PM) to allow full digestion, and might have a second small snack around 9 PM to top up (e.g. one more bagel or a sports drink). They also avoid **gassy vegetables** (onions, broccoli, beans) at this meal to reduce risk of GI discomfort next morning. 
  - **Recreational note:** Eat what has worked for you before long runs. If that’s pizza, choose a thin-crust with not too much cheese or meat (to limit fat). If it’s sushi, that can work (white rice is great, just avoid too many fried tempura or spicy sauces).
- **Pre-race# Optimal Nutrition Strategies for Marathon Training and Racing

Proper nutrition is a **critical component of marathon success**, affecting how well you train, how you feel on race day, and how quickly you recover. Below we outline evidence-based guidelines for **macronutrients**, **micronutrients**, and **supplements**, and provide **practical meal and fueling examples**. We highlight where needs or approaches might differ for **elite vs. recreational runners**, and conclude with key recommendations.

## Macronutrients: Fueling and Recovery Essentials

**Marathoners need a high-carbohydrate diet, adequate protein, and moderate healthy fats.** The proportions may shift slightly (e.g. more carbs during peak training and race week), but all three macros are important:

- **Carbohydrates (CHO)** – **Primary fuel** for training and racing. High carbs maximize muscle glycogen stores and delay fatigue. Marathoners should consume **~5–8 g of carbs per kg body weight daily** in general, and **8–12 g/kg** during heavy training or carb-loading phases. For example, a 60 kg runner might aim for ~300–480 g/day normally, and ~480–720 g/day in the 2–3 days pre-race. **Elites** typically hit the upper end (they have very high caloric needs), but **recreational runners** also require plenty of carbs relative to their body size. Emphasize quality carb sources: grains (pasta, rice, bread, oats), starchy veg (potatoes, corn), fruits, dairy, and sports products (energy gels, sports drinks) around workouts. **Timing:** Focus CHO around runs – eat a carb-rich meal 3–4 hours pre-long run (e.g. bagel + banana), take carbs during runs >90 min (~30–60 g/hour via gels or drink), and refill with carbs soon after (e.g. recovery shake or meal). During the **taper and race week**, ramp up carbs to ~70% of calories to fully carbo-load (see “Race Week” below). **Bottom line:** Make carbohydrates the cornerstone of your diet; they are the limiting fuel in marathons and must be kept high for both elites and age-groupers.

- **Protein** – **Muscle repair and recovery.** Aim for **~1.2–1.6 g of protein per kg body weight daily**. This ensures repair of muscle fibers from high mileage and supports adaptations (like mitochondrial growth). For a 70 kg (154 lb) runner, that’s ~84–112 g protein/day. **Elites** often target the upper end (1.5–1.7 g/kg) to aid recovery during intense training and preserve lean mass, especially if they are on a calorie deficit to reach race weight. **Recreational runners** should hit at least 1.2 g/kg; many benefit from ~1.5 g/kg as well, since it reduces injury risk and soreness. **Distribution:** Spread protein evenly – ~20–30 g each at breakfast, lunch, and dinner, plus protein-rich snacks. For example, an ideal day might include eggs or Greek yogurt in the morning, lean meat or tofu at lunch, a recovery shake with ~20 g whey after a run, and fish or poultry at dinner. **Timing:** Include **~20–30 g protein within 30–60 min after key workouts** (e.g. whey protein with fruit, or chocolate milk) to speed muscle repair. Both elites and recreational runners should prioritize that post-run protein (it’s a habit among pros to always recover with protein). **Bottom line:** Ensure protein at every meal/snack. This keeps your muscles rebuilding stronger after long runs and workouts. A good rule is “20 g protein *4 times a day*” (e.g. each meal + bedtime snack) for consistent muscle fuel.

- **Fats** – **Energy, nutrient absorption, and health.** About **20–30% of your calories** should come from fat (which usually works out to ~1–1.5 g/kg). For example, on a 3000 kcal diet, ~25% fat = ~83 g fat. Focus on **unsaturated fats** for anti-inflammatory and cardiovascular benefits: e.g. avocados, olive or canola oil, nuts, seeds, nut butter, and oily fish (salmon, sardines) rich in omega-3s. Omega-3 fats can help reduce exercise-induced inflammation and muscle soreness. **Include** some fat in meals (for satiety and to help absorb fat-soluble vitamins), but **avoid large amounts of fat right before running or on race morning**, as fats digest slowly and can cause GI upset. For instance, skip the bacon-egg-cheese biscuit before your long run – opt for low-fat, high-carb choices then. **Elites** generally maintain moderate fat intake (~25–30% kcal) except in the final carb-load days when they often cut fat way down to make room for more carbs. **Recreational runners** should similarly moderate fat – don’t go to extremes (neither very high-fat keto diet nor fat-free diet). Very low fat (<15%) can impair hormone levels and recovery; very high fat (>35%) can displace carbs needed for performance. **Bottom line:** Eat healthy fats daily (nuts, seeds, avocado, fish, olive oil), but keep portions reasonable and time your fat intake away from workouts. Both elites and non-elites benefit from the anti-inflammatory properties of unsaturated fats – helping keep joints and tissues healthy through training.

**Key Macro Tips:** 

- **Fuel your training with carbs:** Low muscle glycogen = poor workouts. High-carb availability lets you train harder and recover faster. Do not skimp on carbs to “teach your body to burn fat” – your training itself will improve fat-burning; you risk compromising intensity by under-fueling. (If an advanced athlete does occasional “train low” runs, they should still do high-carb for quality sessions and always race high-carb.)

- **Practice your race fueling** during long runs: For example, an intermediate runner might take one gel every 5 miles in a 20-miler to mimic race day (~40–50 g carb/hour). This trains your gut and ensures you know which products sit well. By race day, both your muscles *and* digestive system will be ready.

- **Prioritize protein around runs:** A tip many elites use: have a protein + carb **recovery snack within 30 minutes** post-run (even if it’s just a quick shake or chocolate milk), then a meal an hour or two later. This jumpstarts repair. Recreational runners should do the same – it significantly reduces muscle soreness and sets you up for tomorrow’s workout.

- **Keep fat moderate, not minimal:** Marathon training is stressful; fats help modulate inflammation and support immune function. Enjoy foods like peanut butter, olive oil on pasta, a handful of walnuts, etc. If you’re trying to lose weight, cut *added sugars or overly large carb portions*, not all the fats – you need some fat for health. Conversely, if you’re following a trendy very high-fat diet, realize that marathoning performance generally suffers on low-carb regimens. Better to use fat as secondary fuel (which your training will naturally adapt you to use) while still giving ample carbs to go fast.

- **Adjust macros for training cycle:** In base training, you might be more balanced (say 50% carb, 25% protein, 25% fat). In peak mileage, bump carbs to ~60–70% and drop fat to ~20% to meet huge carb needs. During race taper, increase carb % further and slightly reduce protein and fat as total calorie needs drop. These shifts apply similarly to elites and recreational runners, just scaled to calorie expenditure.

## Micronutrients: Little Things that Matter

**Marathoners must prevent micronutrient deficiencies**, as even a small shortfall can hinder endurance or recovery. Focus on the following:

### Iron – **Avoid the “iron wall” (fatigue)**  
**Role:** Iron is needed to make hemoglobin in red blood cells, which carry oxygen to muscles. Low iron = low hemoglobin = less O₂ delivery = early fatigue. Iron also is in myoglobin in muscle and in enzymes for energy production. Marathoners (especially females) are at high risk for iron deficiency due to sweat and menstrual losses, GI bleeding from long runs, and often suboptimal intake. 

**Signs of deficiency:** Unusual fatigue, heavy legs, shortness of breath at paces that used to feel fine, pale skin, frequent colds. *Iron deficiency anemia* (low hemoglobin) is extreme end – you want to catch iron storage depletion (low ferritin) *before* it becomes full anemia because even iron deficiency without anemia can hurt performance.

**Intake:** **Men** need ~8–10 mg/day, **women** ~18 mg/day (due to menstrual losses). Many runners (male and female) benefit from higher intakes (e.g. 15 mg for men, 20+ mg for women) to maintain ferritin >30 µg/L. **Eat iron-rich foods daily:**

- **Heme iron (best absorbed):** Lean red meat (beef, venison, bison), dark meat poultry, liver, clams, oysters. *Example:* 3 oz beef has ~2–3 mg, 3 oz chicken ~1 mg, 3 oz liver ~7 mg, 6 oysters ~5 mg. Aim for red meat 2–3 times a week if possible (or more if you tolerate it well and have low iron).
- **Non-heme iron:** Beans (lentils, chickpeas, kidney beans), tofu/tempeh, leafy greens (spinach, kale), fortified cereals, pumpkin seeds, quinoa. *Example:* 1 cup cooked lentils ~6.6 mg, 1 cup cooked spinach ~6 mg, many fortified cereals 8–18 mg per serving. Include a variety – e.g. a spinach salad with beans, or fortified oatmeal with pumpkin seeds and raisins (both added seeds and raisins provide some iron). 

**Boost absorption:** **Pair iron foods with vitamin C**-rich foods ([
            Exploring the Relationship between Micronutrients and Athletic Performance: A Comprehensive Scientific Systematic Review of the Literature in Sports Medicine - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10302780/#:~:text=Iron%20deficiency%2C%20whether%20combined%20with,Dairy%20products%2C%20sardines%20and%20salmon)). Vitamin C can **triple** non-heme iron absorption. Squeeze lemon on spinach, have citrus or berries with iron-fortified cereal, cook tomato sauce with your meat (tomatoes have C). Also, **avoid drinking tea/coffee with high-iron meals** – polyphenols inhibit iron uptake (have your coffee between meals) ([
            Exploring the Relationship between Micronutrients and Athletic Performance: A Comprehensive Scientific Systematic Review of the Literature in Sports Medicine - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10302780/#:~:text=Iron%20deficiency%2C%20whether%20combined%20with,Dairy%20products%2C%20sardines%20and%20salmon)). Calcium competes too; don’t take a calcium supplement at the same time as your iron-rich meal.

**Supplementation:** If you have low ferritin or anemia confirmed by blood test, iron supplements (ferrous sulfate, gluconate, or bisglycinate) can drastically improve your condition. Work with a doctor – typical therapeutic dose is ~65 mg elemental iron (like 325 mg ferrous sulfate) once daily or every other day (recent research suggests alternate-day supplementation may improve absorption and reduce side effects). **DO NOT take high-dose iron “just because”** – too much can cause GI issues and oxidative stress. But **if you’re low, it’s critical to supplement**. Many female runners routinely take a low-dose iron (like 18 mg in a multivitamin or a gentle iron pill) as prophylaxis – this can be wise during heavy training or if you know you tend toward low iron. **Elites** monitor iron closely (frequent blood work) and often use supplements or even iron infusions if needed to keep levels optimal (ferritin ~50 µg/L or more). **Recreational runners** should at least get an annual check if possible, and certainly if experiencing unusual fatigue. 

**Race week note:** If you supplement iron, continue through taper (some advise stopping 1 day before race to avoid any GI irritation). Also, consuming high iron (red meat, spinach) early in race week is good – but avoid a giant steak dinner the night before (heavy to digest). Perhaps have red meat 2–3 nights out instead.

**Bottom line:** **Keep an eye on iron – it’s a performance linchpin**. Both elites and recreational runners suffer if iron is low. Through diet and supplements (if needed), maintain healthy iron stores. A well-fueled marathoner with adequate iron can transport oxygen efficiently and will feel far more energetic than one running on empty iron reserves. As one sports doc says: *“Iron deficiency is like running with the brakes on.”* Remove that brake through proper iron intake. 

### Magnesium – **Smooth muscle function and energy support**  
**Role:** Magnesium is involved in **muscle contraction and relaxation**, energy production (ATP synthesis), and electrolyte balance. It also supports bone health (working with calcium and vitamin D) and helps regulate blood pressure and glucose. Heavy training can lower magnesium status (you lose Mg in sweat and urine, and you use more in metabolic processes). Inadequate magnesium can lead to muscle cramps, tremors, high heart rate, and poor recovery. It's sometimes a hidden culprit behind unexplained fatigue or frequent muscle spasms.

**Intake:** RDA is **400–420 mg/day for men**, **310–320 mg/day for women**. Many people fall short. Marathoners should try to meet or slightly exceed these levels since needs may be higher with training. **Magnesium-rich foods:**

- **Nuts and seeds:** Excellent sources. E.g. 1 oz (28 g) of almonds ~80 mg, cashews ~75 mg, peanuts ~50 mg, pumpkin seeds ~150 mg. A trail mix or peanut butter can pack a lot of Mg.
- **Whole grains:** The germ/bran of grains has Mg. E.g. 1 cup cooked brown rice ~80 mg, 2 slices whole wheat bread ~45 mg, 1 cup oatmeal ~60 mg. Refined grains have much less (processing removes Mg-rich parts).
- **Legumes:** Black beans (~120 mg per cup), edamame (~100 mg/cup), lentils (~70 mg/cup). Also provide iron and protein – great for vegetarian runners.
- **Leafy greens:** Spinach (~150 mg per 1 cup cooked), Swiss chard (~150 mg/cup). Even a cup of raw spinach ~24 mg (so a big salad helps).
- **Other:** Avocado (~58 mg per medium fruit), banana (~32 mg each), dark chocolate (~65 mg per 1 oz of 70%+ cacao – a nice treat that actually aids recovery a bit). Yogurt (~30–50 mg/cup) and fish (~30 mg per 3 oz) contribute smaller amounts.

**Ensure daily sources:** For example, a day that hits magnesium might include oatmeal and banana at breakfast, a spinach salad with beans and pumpkin seeds at lunch, a handful of almonds as a snack, and whole grain pasta with salmon and broccoli at dinner. Both elites and recreational runners should emphasize these foods. If your diet is heavy on refined carbs (which is common during carb-loading), balance it by including some Mg-rich fruit/juice or a supplement.

**Supplementation:** If you struggle to meet needs or have symptoms of low Mg (cramps, poor sleep), consider a **magnesium supplement**. **Magnesium citrate, glycinate, or malate** are well-absorbed forms. A common dose is ~200–400 mg elemental magnesium (e.g. 2 tablets of 150 mg). Taking it before bed can promote relaxation and better sleep (magnesium is known to calm the nervous system). Caution: magnesium can cause loose stools – if that happens, split the dose (morning and night) or try a different form (magnesium glycinate tends to have fewer GI side effects than oxide or citrate). **Elites** often supplement magnesium, especially at training camps (where sweat losses are high) or if blood tests show low-normal Mg – it’s a simple insurance for them to avoid cramps and support recovery. **Recreational runners** who often get muscle cramps (especially nighttime calf cramps) frequently find magnesium helpful in reducing those incidents. 

**Cramp prevention:** While muscle cramps have multifactorial causes, magnesium (along with sodium and potassium) is crucial in muscle contraction-relaxation cycles. Anecdotally, many runners report fewer cramps when magnesium intake is adequate. It’s not a guarantee, but it addresses one potential cause of cramping. (Hydration and training are equally important.)

**Race day:** Magnesium isn’t something you take acutely to improve performance – just ensure you’re not deficient going in. Some runners avoid high-dose magnesium supplements the day before or morning of the race to avoid any laxative effect – if you’ve been supplementing daily, taper off 1–2 days pre-race (your Mg stores will be fine) and rely on foods to meet needs right around race time.

**Bottom line:** **Don’t ignore magnesium.** It’s crucial for **smooth muscle function, heart rhythm, and energy release**. A well-balanced diet with nuts, whole grains, and greens usually covers it, benefiting both elite training capacity and recreational recovery. If diet is lacking, a supplement can safely fill the gap and may very well translate to feeling less fatigued and cramp-prone on long runs. Think of magnesium as maintenance for your “engine” – small but essential.

### Sodium and Electrolytes – **Hydrate Right for Peak Performance**  
**Why:** We addressed this in macros (sodium as part of hydration), but it bears emphasis: **electrolytes (especially sodium, plus potassium)** maintain fluid balance, nerve impulses, and muscle contractions during exercise. In a marathon, failing to manage electrolytes can lead to dehydration or **hyponatremia** (low blood sodium), either of which severely impairs performance and can be dangerous. Proper electrolyte intake:
- Helps **prevent muscle cramps** (which often correlate with heavy sweat and electrolyte loss).
- Allows you to **retain water** you drink (sodium makes you absorb fluid and hold it, rather than just peeing clear water out).
- Sustains **blood volume and cooling** – critical for endurance. Even 2% body weight dehydration can hurt performance; some sodium helps you drink enough without diluting blood.
- Avoids **overhydration** – by encouraging you to drink to thirst (sodium in drinks increases palatability and triggers thirst appropriately) and replacing what’s lost. Pure water in excess can cause blood sodium to drop – which has caused many mid-pack runners to collapse despite “not being dehydrated.” Including sodium prevents that by keeping blood sodium in normal range.

**Key Electrolytes:**
- **Sodium (Na):** Primary extracellular electrolyte lost in sweat (sweat typically has 800–1200 mg Na per liter, though it varies). **Goal:** Replace at least ~30–50% of sweat sodium during the race. In practice, that means ~300–600 mg Na per hour for most (adjust higher if you know you’re a “salty sweater” with white salt streaks on clothes, or lower if you sweat lightly). Achieve this by drinking sports drinks (typically ~200–300 mg Na per 8 oz) and/or taking salt caps (usually ~200 mg each) during the race. Example: Drinking ~16 oz Gatorade Endurance (310 mg Na) + eating a few salty pretzels (~300 mg) over an hour gives ~600+ mg – good for a heavy sweater. A lighter sweater might drink 8 oz sports drink (155 mg) + water + a gel with some sodium (100 mg) to total ~250 mg/hr, which could suffice in cool conditions. **Find your personal sweet spot in training.**
- **Potassium (K):** Sweat has far less K than Na (about 1/4th or less). Marathoners usually get plenty via diet (fruits, veggies, sports drinks have some). Aim for 3000–4700 mg/day. A banana (~400 mg) or coconut water (~600 mg per cup) post-run helps restore K. Many sports drinks provide ~30–50 mg K per 8 oz – a small contribution but helps. Potassium is vital for cardiac function and avoiding cramps, but deficiency is rarer than sodium issues in events. Ensuring you eat produce and perhaps including a source of K in recovery (e.g. tomato juice or orange juice) will cover it.
- **Calcium (Ca) and Magnesium (Mg):** Also lost in sweat in small amounts; we covered intake above. As long as you meet daily needs and have a varied electrolyte intake, you’ll replenish these in recovery. Some advanced electrolyte mixes include a little Ca/Mg (since long-term heavy sweating could deplete them). Generally, focus on Ca/Mg in diet and Na/K during the race.
- **Chloride** accompanies sodium in salt (sodium chloride); it’s automatically replaced when you ingest sodium. 
- **The “other” electrolytes (zinc, etc.)** are lost in trace amounts – not significant acutely, but those come via diet or a multi over time.

**Strategy:** 
- **During Training:** Practice drinking to thirst and using sports drinks on long runs. Note if you tend to cramp toward the end – if so, increase sodium next time (e.g. add a salt pill or a higher-sodium drink like Pedialyte). Weigh yourself before and after long runs to gauge sweat rate (1 kg weight loss = ~1 L fluid deficit). Aim to limit deficit to <2% body weight by drinking some fluid during the run. If you gain weight, you’re overdrinking. This exercise helps calibrate your race plan. *Elite runners* often have sweat tests done (measuring sweat composition and rate in a lab or via patches) to precisely tailor fluid-electrolyte plans. *Recreational runners* can approximate: if you lose >1.5 L/hour and your sweat tastes very salty or leaves salt on skin, lean high on sodium; if you lose <0.5 L/hour and don’t see salt crusts, you can go lighter on sodium (but still get some).
- **Pre-race:** In the 12–24 hours pre-race, consume electrolytes along with fluids. For instance, **salt your pre-race meals to taste** (don’t go low-sodium), and consider an electrolyte drink the evening before and/or morning of the race. Many runners will drink 500 mL of a sports drink the night before and another 500 mL the morning of (gradually). This “pre-loading” of sodium (~300–700 mg in those drinks) can expand blood volume slightly and ensure you start fully hydrated without overdrinking plain water. **Elite example:** Some elites take ~1000 mg sodium as part of ~600 mL fluid the night before a hot marathon (hyper-hydration protocol) – e.g. drinking a product like Skratch Labs Hyper Hydration (contains sodium ~1700 mg/L). For a normal marathon, just maintaining normal salt intake is fine – e.g. eat a salty snack like pretzels or broth-based soup at dinner and have a sports drink in the morning. **Recreational example:** Have a bowl of chicken noodle soup (salt + fluid) as part of dinner, and sip 8–12 oz of sports drink with breakfast. The goal is starting the race hydrated and with normal plasma electrolyte levels.
- **During race:** As mentioned in section 1, **consume ~300–600 mg sodium per hour** (and ~0.4–0.8 L fluid per hour, adjusting to conditions and individual tolerance). Practically, this could be: drink a cup of sports drink (~150–200 mg Na) at every aid station and take a salt capsule (~200 mg) every hour. Or, if you carry your own drink, use a higher-sodium formulation (some DIY or commercial mixes have ~500 mg per 500 mL). Ensure you also get some **potassium** – most sports drinks have ~30–50 mg per cup, which suffices when combined with normal diet. If you use only gels + water, be mindful: most gels have modest sodium (e.g. ~50–100 mg). You may need to supplement with electrolyte tablets or consume some salty food (some aid stations offer pretzels or chips in latter miles). One trick many mid-pack runners use is **bringing a small ziplock of pretzels** or taking the pretzels offered on course – they provide both carbs and ~300 mg sodium per handful, and are easy to chew if you take a sip of water with them.
- **Post-race:** We’ll discuss recovery, but as a micronutrient note: after finishing, **replenish electrolytes along with fluids**. A good approach is to drink an electrolyte beverage (sports drink, coconut water with salt added, or a recovery drink that includes sodium) and eat something salty (pretzels, salted crackers, pickles) soon after finishing. Aim to **restore weight lost** – e.g. if down 2 kg, drink ~2–3 L over the next few hours with sodium present. Elites often get an IV saline if severely dehydrated (but that’s a medical scenario). Most runners can do it orally: have a bottle of sports drink and some soup or salty snacks within the next hour. This ensures proper rehydration and sets you up for recovery.

**Elite vs Recreational differences:** 
- **Elites** sweat more absolute fluid but for less time (a 2:10 marathoner might lose 3–4 L; a 4:20 marathoner might lose 4–5 L). Elites are extremely careful to avoid both dehydration (which would impair performance) and overhydration (rare for them, since they know not to drink excessively). They often use custom bottles – e.g. one might have a bottle with 500 mL of 6% carb solution + 300 mg Na at 10K, another at 20K, etc. They dial this in training. 
- **Recreational runners** sometimes neglect electrolytes (“I’ll just drink water when I’m thirsty”) – which can lead to hyponatremia if they drink too much water, or to cramps if they under-replace salt. The common practice of taking one or two **salt sticks (salt capsules) mid-race** is a good safety net for heavy sweaters. Also, slower runners are on course in the heat of day, so they might actually face tougher hydration challenges than elites who finish before it gets hot. They should make use of the aid station offerings of sports drinks and salty foods. For instance, if on pace for 5 hours, absolutely incorporate the sports drink at most stations, not just water, and nibble something salty or take electrolyte chews hourly. Many big marathons now provide bananas or sports beans (which have some electrolytes) – use them to complement your water intake. 
- One difference: **elites rarely stop** at stations – they grab and go. Recreational runners can afford to slow slightly to drink properly (which is better than spilling it all or choking). But do practice drinking on the run – it’s a skill.

**Bottom line:** **Hydrate with electrolytes, not just plain water, especially sodium**. This applies to all marathoners:
- Start the race well-hydrated (urine pale, not overfull stomach) with normal salt levels.
- Replace a good portion of sweat losses during the race with fluids that contain sodium.
- Listen to thirst (it’s a good guide), and make sure what you drink includes electrolytes (sports drinks, salt caps, salty snacks).
- Avoid excessive water intake without salt (to prevent hyponatremia), and avoid taking in nothing at all for 26.2 miles (to prevent >2–3% dehydration). The middle ground, guided by thirst and a fueling plan, is where performance is best.

### Other Micronutrients of Note:
- **Calcium:** Essential for bones and muscle contractions. Many runners, especially females, fall short on calcium, risking stress fractures. Get ~1000 mg/day (e.g. 3 servings dairy or fortified alternatives). *Tip:* Have a glass of milk or almond milk with meals or a cup of yogurt as a snack. **Elites** often get regular DEXA scans for bone density and ensure Ca/D intake is adequate, since a fracture can derail an entire season. **Recreational** runners should take bone health seriously too – consistent intake of calcium (and vitamin D) plus weight-bearing training is best prevention. 
- **Vitamin D:** Works with calcium for bone strength and has roles in muscle function. Many athletes are deficient, especially if training indoors or at high latitudes in winter. Aim for blood level >30 ng/mL. If sun exposure is low, supplement ~1000–2000 IU/day. It can improve muscle recovery and immune function when corrected (low D is linked to muscle weakness). Check your multivitamin – many now include ~1000 IU D. If not, consider a separate D3 supplement. Take with a meal containing fat for absorption. 
- **Zinc:** Important for immune health and tissue repair (deficiency can mean slow wound healing and frequent illnesses). Found in meats (beef, dark poultry) and seafood (shellfish are loaded – e.g. 6 oysters have far above daily zinc needs). Also in beans and whole grains (though less absorbed due to phytates). Most runners who eat meat get enough; vegetarians might need ~50% more or a supplement (10–15 mg/day). If you catch colds often, check zinc intake. Many multi-vits have ~15 mg which suffices. 
- **B-Vitamins:** Marathoners burn through a lot of energy, so ensure B-vitamin intake is adequate for energy metabolism and red blood cell production. **B12** and **folate** are crucial to avoid anemia (besides iron) – found in meat, dairy (B12) and leafy greens, beans, citrus (folate) or fortified cereals. Vegetarians *must* supplement B12 or eat fortified foods (B12 is only naturally in animal foods) to avoid deficiency. **Thiamin (B1), Riboflavin (B2), Niacin (B3), B6** are abundant in whole grains, nuts, meats, and veggies. As long as you eat a varied diet with unprocessed foods, you likely cover these. Heavy drinkers or those on highly refined diets might miss some – a multi covers it. 
- **Vitamin C:** Already mentioned with iron and immunity – aim to get plenty (fruits and veggies daily). This helps collagen formation (for tendon repair) and acts as an antioxidant. Some elites take extra C (500 mg) in final weeks of training to reduce oxidative stress and after races to reduce DOMS (delayed soreness), but megadoses aren’t needed for most (food suffices). 
- **Vitamin E & Selenium:** Important antioxidants. Found in nuts/seeds (vit E) and Brazil nuts, seafood, grains (selenium). Marathon training generates free radicals; having enough E and selenium helps neutralize them. A balanced diet with nuts, seeds, and grains covers these. One Brazil nut a day covers selenium needs – a popular hack among athletes.
- **“Miscellaneous”:** 
  - **Potassium:** We addressed with electrolytes – just eat fruits, veg, dairy to meet the ~4700 mg/day. Most runners do if they eat produce (an 8 oz glass of OJ has ~450 mg, a baked potato ~900 mg, a banana ~400 mg, etc.). 
  - **Iodine:** Needed for thyroid function (metabolism). Found in iodized salt, seafood, and dairy. If you use iodized table salt on your food (as most do), you’re fine. If you only use fancy sea salt (often low iodine) and don’t eat much seafood or dairy, consider a multivitamin with iodine (150 mcg). Low iodine can cause sluggishness (hypothyroid).
  - **Chromium:** Assists insulin function – found in whole grains, meat, and cheese. Usually fine if diet is balanced.
  - **Choline:** Often grouped with B-vitamins, needed for neurotransmitters (acetylcholine) in muscle contraction. Found in egg yolks, beef, soy. One reason eggs are a great recovery food – they give choline which might support nerve-muscle signaling. 

**Takeaway:** For micronutrients, **eat a varied, colorful diet**:
- Plenty of **vegetables (especially leafy greens)** and **fruits** (for C, K, potassium, and others).
- **Whole grains, nuts, and legumes** (for B’s, magnesium, zinc).
- **Lean meats and/or fortified cereals** (for iron and B12). Vegetarians/vegans should use fortified foods or supplements for B12 and possibly iron/zinc.
- **Dairy or alternatives** (for calcium, D, iodine if using iodized salt). If dairy-free, ensure you get calcium from fortified plant milk or take a calcium supplement (~500 mg) plus D.
- **Salt your food to taste**, especially in training (for sodium and iodine if iodized) – do not eliminate salt unless medically required, because athletes need it.
- Consider a **daily multivitamin** as a nutritional safety net, especially during heavy training when needs are high and appetite might actually drop (some runners experience suppressed appetite in peak training due to fatigue – a multi can help cover any deficits). 

Both elites and recreational runners benefit from these micro strategies: elites often fine-tune with blood tests and nutritionists, whereas recreational runners can cover most bases with a balanced “food first” approach and a simple multivitamin. The key is to **prevent deficiencies** – the goal isn’t megadoses to become “superhuman,” but rather not having any weak links. As a marathoner, think of micros as the tools that keep your engine running smoothly – if any tool is missing (low iron, low magnesium, etc.), your performance will suffer even if macros are on point.

## Supplements: Proven Aids for Marathon Performance

Beyond whole foods, certain **ergogenic supplements** can give marathoners a legal, safe performance or recovery boost. Here we focus on those with strong scientific evidence:

### Caffeine – **Proven to Improve Endurance and Focus**  
**What:** Caffeine (found in coffee, tea, cola, energy drinks, pills, gums) is a well-established performance enhancer for endurance events. It **lowers perceived effort, improves alertness, and helps you maintain pace longer** by affecting the central nervous system (blocking fatigue signals) and possibly muscle directly (increasing calcium availability for contractions). It also spares glycogen slightly by increasing fat utilization (though this effect is secondary – the main benefit is you feel less tired).

**Evidence:** Meta-analyses show caffeine yields an average **~2–4% improvement in endurance performance** (time trial or time to exhaustion) in both trained and untrained individuals. For a 3:30 marathoner, 3% is ~6 minutes – quite significant. It benefits elites similarly (in a close race, a 1–2% edge is huge). Virtually all studies on marathon simulation (running ~1 hr or cycling 2+ hrs) show caffeine helps – runners run faster or feel better at the same pace on caffeine vs. placebo.

**How to use:** 
- **Dosage:** **3–6 mg per kg body weight** about 60 minutes before exercise. For example, a 60 kg (132 lb) runner: ~180–360 mg. A 80 kg runner: ~240–480 mg. Taking more than ~6 mg/kg usually doesn’t add benefit and can increase side effects (≥9 mg/kg can cause jitters, GI upset, etc.). Many athletes do well with ~3–4 mg/kg. If you’re new to caffeine, start at 2–3 mg/kg (~100–150 mg) and see how you react.
- **Timing:** **~45–60 minutes pre-run/race** is ideal for peak blood levels. E.g. Drink your coffee ~1 hour before the gun. If using caffeine gum (which absorbs faster through oral tissues), you can take it ~15–30 min before. 
- **Form:** Choose your preferred source:
  - **Coffee:** A 8-oz (240 ml) cup has ~80–100 mg, a 12-oz Starbucks tall brewed coffee ~235 mg. Know your coffee’s strength. Many runners use their normal coffee routine on race morning (for familiarity and to help with bowel movement). 
  - **Tea:** Weaker (~30–60 mg per cup black tea). Might need larger volume or supplement with another source.
  - **Caffeine pills:** Very convenient and precise. Commonly 200 mg per tablet (e.g. NoDoz, Vivarin). You can even break them in half if you want ~100 mg. Take with water. Pro tip: if coffee upsets your stomach but you want caffeine, a pill can avoid the stomach acid response from coffee.
  - **Caffeine chewables or gels:** Some energy gels have caffeine (often 20–50 mg per gel). Chewable energy blocks or jelly beans sometimes contain ~25–50 mg per serving. These can be used pre-run or during (see below). 
  - **Caffeine gum:** Brands like Run Gum or caffeinated gum (100 mg per 2 pieces typically). Absorbs quickly via mouth. Athletes sometimes chew 1–2 pieces 10 minutes before the start (for a last-minute jolt).
  - **Energy drinks:** (e.g. Red Bull, Monster) – These have ~80–160 mg per can plus sugar. They work, but the carbonation and acidity may bother some stomachs. Also, you’re adding extra simple sugars that you might prefer to get from a sports drink. If you like them, it’s an option (just be mindful of total fluid volume so you’re not overfull).
  - **Pre-workout powders:** Many contain caffeine plus other stimulants or amino acids (beta-alanine, etc.). Some elites do use them carefully. If you choose this, ensure it’s a batch-tested product (to avoid banned substances) and try it in training first – some contain things that cause tingling (beta-alanine) or a flush (niacin). Simpler is often better (just caffeine alone).
- **During race “maintenance”:** Caffeine’s half-life is ~5–6 hours, so one dose covers most marathons. But taking a **small caffeine top-up mid-race** can help sustain its benefits, especially for slower runners. E.g. if you took 200 mg pre-race at 7 AM, by 10 AM (3 hr later) you might benefit from another 50–100 mg as levels drop. This can be via a caffeinated gel at mile 16–20. Many runners plan one **caffeinated gel late in the race** (around 30K) to get a mental and physical boost when fatigue hits. For example, an elite might take 100 mg at 1:15 into a race to sharpen focus for the final 30 minutes; a recreational runner might take 50 mg around mile 18 and another 50 mg at mile 23 (via gels or gum). Be careful not to overdo total intake – consider how much you took pre-race. Aim to stay ≤~6 mg/kg total on the day. *Example plan:* 150 mg pre-race, 40 mg gel at halfway, 40 mg gel at 20 miles = ~230 mg total for a 60 kg runner (3.8 mg/kg) – effective yet within moderate range. 
- **Practice:** Absolutely practice your caffeine strategy in training. If you never have coffee and suddenly take 300 mg on race day, you may get the “caffeine jitters” or GI distress (or a fantastic race – but better to know in advance!). Try using caffeine before a few long runs or hard workouts to see how it affects you. Most find it noticeably reduces RPE (rating of perceived effort) – hills feel easier, motivation is higher. Some find it can cause an initial heart rate spike or nervous energy – that usually stabilizes once running. If you get anxious or shaky, lower the dose next time. 
- **Side effects management:** Common issues: 
  - *GI urgency:* Coffee, especially, can stimulate a quick bowel movement (helpful if timed right before you leave home!). But too much caffeine or taking it very late (like at the start line) could lead to needing a porta-potty mid-race. Solution: take caffeine sufficiently early and evacuate bowels pre-race. If coffee always causes diarrhea, switch to a pill or different source (which often cause less lower-GI stimulation since coffee has compounds beyond caffeine that trigger the gut). 
  - *Jitters:* If you feel too wired or shaky, either reduce dose or try taking it slightly earlier so by race start you’ve settled a bit. Also ensure you’ve eaten – caffeine on an empty stomach can hit harder. Having it with your breakfast can smooth absorption.
  - *Increased urine output:* Caffeine is mildly diuretic at rest, but during exercise its diuretic effect is blunted. Still, if you chug a large coffee, you’ll likely have to pee once. Plan bathroom trips accordingly (e.g. drink it 1.5 h out so you can urinate 45 min out, then you’re set). On course, caffeine doesn’t significantly contribute to dehydration at normal doses – you don’t need extra water *because* you took caffeine (just maintain your planned hydration).
  - *Sleep issues:* Not directly race-performance related, but if you race in the morning, caffeine’s effect will be mostly gone by bedtime. If you have an afternoon/evening race (less common for marathons), be cautious – even a 3 pm dose could make it hard to sleep by 10 pm. However, most key marathons are AM, so not a problem on race day. Do consider this in training: if you do a long run with caffeine on Sunday morning, that night’s sleep should be fine; but avoid taking a caffeine booster for a late evening hard workout if you need to sleep after.

**Who benefits:** Virtually **everyone** (except those with medical contraindications or extreme sensitivity). **Elites** almost universally use caffeine unless they personally don’t respond well – it’s one of the most ergogenic legal aids. **Recreational runners** arguably benefit even more – not only physically but mentally (caffeine can improve mood and confidence). If you’re not using caffeine and have no health reason to avoid it, it’s a low-hanging performance booster.

**Bottom line:** **Use caffeine strategically for your marathon.** A common approach: have your usual morning coffee (or equivalent caffeine) ~1–1.5 hr before the race, then consider a caffeinated gel or chew in the later miles. Expect to feel more energized and less perceivably strained – a big asset in an endurance event. Remember, it’s not cheating – it’s simply leveraging a well-researched tool that’s accepted in endurance sports. As one study bluntly concluded: *“Caffeine can be used to improve running performance – in doses typical of everyday consumption – without harmful side effects”*. Use it to your advantage.

### Nitrates (Beetroot Juice) – **Fuel for Efficiency**  
**What:** **Dietary nitrates** (commonly via beetroot juice or concentrated beet shots) convert in the body to **nitric oxide (NO)**. NO dilates blood vessels (improving blood flow) and enhances mitochondrial efficiency (you get more ATP per unit O₂). In plain terms, nitrates make your body **use oxygen more efficiently** – effectively boosting your running economy (lower O₂ cost at a given pace). This can help you run faster for the same effort or extend time to exhaustion.

**Evidence:** Many studies show **beetroot juice supplementation improves endurance performance**, especially in events 5–30 minutes long. For longer events like marathons, results are still positive overall, though individual responses vary. Notably:
- Nitrates tend to have **bigger effects in less-trained individuals** (because elites are already near optimal efficiency) ([
            Nutrition and Supplement Update for the Endurance Athlete: Review and Recommendations - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6628334/#:~:text=can%20improve%20muscle%20economy%2C%20efficiency,12%20%2C%2072%2C52%20%2C%2074)). Recreational runners often see improved times or lower perceived effort with beet juice.
- Studies on cycling time trials ~60–90 min found modest performance gains (~2–3%) and reduced perceived exertion.
- A study on trained runners found that after 15 days of beet juice, they had a lower VO₂ at the same running speed (improved economy) and an enhanced **critical velocity** (akin to lactate threshold) ([
            Nutrition and Supplement Update for the Endurance Athlete: Review and Recommendations - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6628334/#:~:text=can%20improve%20muscle%20economy%2C%20efficiency,elite%20athletes%29%20%5B12%2C51%2C52%2C53)).
- Many anecdotal reports from athletes: feeling “stronger” in the later stages, or having a slightly faster finish, when using nitrates.

**How to use:**
- **Dosage:** ~6–8 mmol of nitrate (~500 mg nitrate) is a standard effective dose. This is typically provided by **~500 ml (2 cups) of beetroot juice** or **one concentrated beetroot “shot”** (like Beet It Sport shot = ~400 mg nitrate). Some protocols use 2 shots (~12 mmol) spread out. 
- **Timing:** **2–3 hours before exercise** ([
            Nutrition and Supplement Update for the Endurance Athlete: Review and Recommendations - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6628334/#:~:text=results,suboptimal%20time%20interval%20for%20exercise)). Nitrates from the juice are first converted to nitrite by bacteria in your mouth, then to NO in the body – that process takes ~2–3 hrs to peak. Plan to consume beet juice ~2.5 hrs pre-race (e.g. if race at 7:30, drink at 5:00). Avoid antiseptic mouthwash or gum right after (it can kill the oral bacteria needed for conversion). 
- **Loading vs acute:** Studies show both acute (~2–3 hrs prior) and chronic (multiple days) supplementation can help. **Common strategy:** Start **2–3 days before race**, drinking ~1 beet shot (~70 ml) each day (e.g. morning or with a meal), and one shot on race morning 2–3 hrs out. This “loads” muscle with nitrate, possibly giving a more consistent effect. If taking only one dose, do it on race morning as above. 
- **Food sources:** If you prefer foods, eat **nitrate-rich veggies** in race week: spinach, arugula (rocket), celery, beets, lettuce. For example, an arugula salad and beet smoothie (or roasted beets) in the 1–2 days prior can contribute. However, to get ~500 mg nitrate, you’d need ~3 cups of raw spinach or ~2–3 medium beets – which is fine if cooked (to reduce bulk). Still, beet juice is convenient because it’s concentrated and low-fiber (important when trying to avoid GI load pre-race).
- **Practice in training:** Try beet juice before a hard long run or tempo to ensure no GI issues. A minority of people might experience slight stomach discomfort or beet-urine/stool (red coloration) – the latter is harmless but can be alarming if unexpected. Practicing also lets you gauge any performance feeling – many notice they can hold pace at a slightly lower heart rate or feel “less winded” on hills. 
- **Elite vs Recreational:** **Elites** use nitrates to eke out any efficiency gain – even if it’s <1%, that can decide podium spots. They often do multi-day loading. Some elites (e.g. elite race walkers, triathletes) have reported measurable improvements. **Recreational runners** often feel a noticeable difference – e.g. "the pace felt easier" or "I didn't hit the wall as hard." They have more room for improvement in economy, so nitrates can have a larger effect (maybe 1–3% performance gain, which could be several minutes). For a recreational runner who might struggle with late-race fatigue, the improved efficiency plus nitrates’ blood-flow benefits (possibly delaying that creeping fatigue) can be very beneficial. 
- **Safety:** Beetroot juice from natural sources is safe. It will make your urine or bowel movements pinkish/red (beeturia) in ~10–15% of people – just a heads-up. If you have low blood pressure, be aware nitrates can lower BP slightly (by ~5 mmHg) – monitor how you feel (usually not an issue unless you already run very low). It's legal and not on any banned list (NO is a normal body molecule). Just use a trusted beet juice product to avoid any contamination risk.

**Bottom line:** **Consider nitrate supplementation (beetroot juice) to enhance your endurance efficiency.** It’s one of the few supplements that directly improves exercise economy. To implement:
- **Start ~3 days out**: Drink ~70 ml concentrated beet juice (or 500 ml regular beet juice) once per day.
- **On race morning**: Drink ~1 serving (~300–500 mg nitrate) about 2–2.5 hours pre-start (can be part of your breakfast routine).
- **Don’t** use strong mouthwash near the time (to let oral bacteria do their job).
- Continue eating your normal high-carb meals – beet juice is an addition, not a replacement for carbs.
- Enjoy the benefit of feeling a bit more *smooth* and efficient in your running. Many describe it as “my easy pace felt easier” or “I could push late without that burning fatigue as soon.” That could make the difference between hitting the wall at mile 23 vs. mile 25 – a significant advantage.

### Creatine – **Building Strength for the Final Stretch**  
**What:** **Creatine monohydrate** is known for boosting strength and power in short bursts by increasing muscle phosphocreatine stores. While marathon running is aerobic, creatine can benefit marathoners in indirect ways:
- **Improved finishing kick / surges:** A marathon often comes down to the last mile or a sprint finish for place (especially in elite races, but even recreational runners like to kick to break 4:00 or beat a rival). Creatine increases the energy available for brief high-intensity efforts. Studies show it can improve performance in end-spurts after prolonged exercise. In practical terms, if you have creatine loaded muscles, you might sprint 100–200 m at the finish faster or surge up a hill more effectively without as much fatigue. 
- **Glycogen enhancement:** Creatine loading has been shown to amplify glycogen loading – one study noted a ~10% greater muscle glycogen storage when athletes combined creatine + carbohydrate loading vs. carbs alone. More glycogen means more fuel late in the race, potentially delaying “the wall.” 
- **Recovery and injury prevention:** Creatine is linked to reduced muscle cell damage and inflammation after exhaustive exercise ([
            Creatine supplementation and endurance performance: surges and sprints to win the race - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10132248/#:~:text=co,In%20contrast%2C%20creatine)). It also can help maintain lean muscle mass during heavy training. Marathoners (especially masters athletes) sometimes lose muscle with all the mileage; creatine, combined with strength training, can mitigate that. This means stronger connective tissues and better running economy (stronger muscles = more efficient stride). 
- **Training quality:** If you incorporate hill repeats, sprint intervals, or strength training, creatine will improve your capacity in those sessions, leading to greater adaptations that ultimately benefit your marathon (improved running economy, finishing speed, etc.). 

**Drawback – water weight:** Creatine typically causes **1–2 kg of water retention** initially (muscles hold more water along with creatine). Extra weight can slightly increase the energy cost of running (~0.5–1% slower per kg for distance running, rule of thumb). This is why some distance runners avoid creatine – they don’t want any added weight. However, strategies to manage this:
- Use a **low-dose protocol**: e.g. 3–5 g/day (instead of 20 g loading) for longer – this still saturates muscles but more gradually, often with less bloating. 
- **Stop supplementation 1–2 weeks before the race**: You’ll shed the water weight quickly once off creatine, but the muscular benefits (increased PCr and possibly residual training adaptations from using it) may persist through race day. 
- Accept a small weight trade-off for potential performance gain. For a non-elite, carrying 1 kg extra for the chance to sprint 5 sec faster at the end or avoid slowing as much on hills might be worth it. For an elite, 1 kg is more critical – many elites only use creatine in off-season or if they feel the power benefit will outweigh the weight (like a hilly course maybe).

**Evidence:** Creatine has clear benefits for **short-duration high-intensity outputs** (sprints, jumps). Its direct effect on pure endurance (VO₂max, steady-state times) is less obvious – some studies show no change in 5K time (due to weight) while others show improved end-sprint in a 5K or better performance in intermittent workloads. For marathoning, think of it as a way to **raise your anaerobic ceiling** (so marathon is further below your max) and as a training aid. It's well-established that creatine + strength training = increased strength/power – something even marathoners benefit from in terms of running economy. Also, creatine might help during those surges in a race (for elites, mid-race surges; for recreational, maybe surging up a steep bridge or through fatigue). 

**Use:** 
- **Loading:** Traditional loading is 20 g/day (split into 4 doses of 5 g) for 5–7 days, then 3–5 g/day maintenance. This will maximize stores quickly but is more likely to cause bloating or GI upset. 
- **Low and slow:** Alternatively, take 3–5 g/day consistently for 3–4 weeks – you reach saturation a bit slower but with minimal side effects. Many prefer this gentler approach. 
- **Timing:** Can be taken any time of day. Taking it with a meal that has carbs (and protein) can aid uptake (insulin helps muscle creatine absorption). Post-workout with your recovery shake is convenient for many. Stay well-hydrated (creatine draws water into muscle; you need to drink enough to allow that and maintain overall hydration).
- **During training cycle:** Consider using creatine in early and mid training when doing heavy workouts and possibly discontinue before taper to drop any extra weight. For instance, use from week 1 of training until ~2–3 weeks out, then stop. Your muscles will remain loaded for at least a few weeks after stopping, and you likely lose the little water weight in that time. This strategy is used by some distance coaches to get the benefits in training but minimize potential race weight impact.
- **During race:** Don’t take creatine on race day – it’s not an acute aid (and you wouldn’t want any stomach heaviness from it). It’s about loading over time.

**Elite vs Recreational:** 
- **Elites**: Some avoid creatine due to weight paranoia; others, especially those who include a lot of conditioning and want a strong finish, do use it (often covertly – it’s not visible like caffeine use). Notably, Mo Farah’s coach mentioned Farah tried creatine early in his career (for final lap kick) but Mo felt it made him heavy, so he stopped. Other elites may find it works fine for them. It's an individual call. Track athletes (5K/10K) more commonly use creatine than marathoners, but with the marathon getting more competitive, some marathoners might adopt it to cover that tactical final push or hill surges.
- **Recreational**: Many rec runners might not think of creatine for a marathon, but those who cross-train with gym work may already take it and find it helps them maintain leg strength through the training cycle. If a recreational runner tends to *feel* weak or loses muscle mass in marathon prep, creatine could help counter that. Also, if you have a background in power sports or just respond well to creatine, you could continue it – just be mindful of hydration and weight.

**Safety:** Creatine is one of the most researched supplements – it’s very safe for healthy individuals. The main side effects are GI upset if taking too much at once (split the dose if so) and the water retention. It does not cause kidney damage in healthy people (a myth, unless you have pre-existing kidney disease in which case you should consult a doctor). It doesn’t cause muscle cramps or dehydration if you maintain normal fluid intake (actually it may reduce cramps by keeping muscles hydrated). During taper, if you drop it, no withdrawal or anything – you simply gradually lose the extra water.

**Bottom line:** **Creatine is a useful (though optional) supplement for marathoners to consider, primarily to support training quality and allow a stronger finish.** If you decide to use it:
- Load with 3–5 g/day for several weeks (starting early in the training cycle).
- Monitor your weight and how you feel; if weight gain is concerning, plan to discontinue ~3 weeks before the marathon.
- Enjoy potentially better high-intensity outputs – e.g. find your interval times improving or you can do one more hill rep without exhaustion (a sign it’s helping).
- Come race day, you might have a little extra “pop” in your legs for that final push, and you’ll have reaped training benefits (strength, glycogen storage).
- If you choose not to use creatine, no problem – it’s not as crucial as carbs or caffeine. It’s a fine-tuning tool. Many marathoners achieve great results without it. It’s more about squeezing out small improvements once the big pieces are in place.

### Beta-Alanine – **Buffering in the final miles**  
**What:** **Beta-alanine** is an amino acid that elevates muscle **carnosine** levels (an intramuscular buffer). Higher carnosine = better buffering of hydrogen ions (H+) generated during intense exercise, delaying muscle acidity (the “burn”) and fatigue. It’s proven to enhance performance in events lasting 1–4 minutes (800m to 1500m) by ~2–3%. A marathon is run below the lactate threshold for elites and maybe near threshold for some recreational runners in the later miles. Beta-alanine won’t significantly affect the aerobic portion of the race (since you ideally aren’t accumulating a ton of lactate until maybe the end), but it can:
- **Raise your lactate threshold slightly:** Some studies indicate beta-alanine supplementation can allow athletes to sustain a slightly higher intensity before lactate accumulates rapidly. For a marathoner, a higher threshold could mean holding goal pace with less drift into anaerobic zone later on. It basically gives you a bit more “buffer” in the engine.
- **Help in surges or the finishing kick:** If you need to throw in a 400m surge or sprint the last 200m, beta-alanine-fueled carnosine buffering can let you do that with less acid buildup. It may not shave minutes, but perhaps a few seconds – which matter for PRs, BQ times, or placing.
- **Improve interval training capacity:** By buffering H+, beta-alanine can help you perform slightly more reps or slightly faster reps in hard workouts. Over a training block, this could translate to better fitness gains. Marathon training isn’t highly lactic, but tempo runs and VO₂max workouts do produce some H+ – beta-alanine could allow a stronger finish to those sessions (e.g. last 10 minutes of a tempo at steady lactate, not rising).
- **Reduce late-race fatigue sensations:** One hypothesis is that some late-race fatigue is from accumulating metabolites (H+, K+, etc.) in muscle as they become fatigued or recruit fast-twitch fibers. Beta-alanine might help buffer any localized acidity when those fast-twitch fibers kick in (like when slow-twitch fibers are exhausted around mile 20 and you start recruiting more type II fibers – those produce more lactate). It’s speculative but plausible that beta-alanine could help you feel slightly less “heavy-legged” in that scenario.

**Use:** 
- Beta-alanine requires **chronic loading (not acute)**. You need to take **~4–6 g per day for 4–8 weeks** to significantly raise muscle carnosine. After ~4 weeks, carnosine can increase ~40–60%, after 8–12 weeks up to ~80%. The timing of doses each day isn’t critical – but split into smaller doses (e.g. 2 g x 3 times/day) to avoid the common side effect of **paresthesia** (tingling skin, especially face/hands). This tingling is harmless and usually subsides in <60 min, but can be uncomfortable. Using sustained-release beta-alanine or taking with meals can lessen it.
- Start loading at least **4–8 weeks before your race** (the earlier the better). Many runners start at the beginning of a training cycle. You can continue through race day (no need to stop; having high carnosine in muscle on race day is the goal).
- **Dose schedule example:** 1.6 g with breakfast, 1.6 g with lunch, 1.6 g with dinner (~4.8 g/day). Or 2 g + 2 g + 2 g (~6 g/day). Find what you tolerate (some people get tingle even at 1.6 g; they may go 1 g 6x/day or use a time-release product like SR CarnoSyn). 
- **Elite vs Recreational:** **Elites** sometimes incorporate beta-alanine if they are also doing track races or if they expect tactical pace changes. Marathon-only elites vary – some may find it unnecessary given they rarely go anaerobic in the race, others might take it as part of an all-around supplement regimen because it could help them in training and it doesn’t harm. **Recreational runners** might benefit relatively more if their marathon pace is closer to lactate threshold (some recreational runners, especially those around 4+ hours, might actually accumulate more lactate as they fatigue). For them, beta-alanine could potentially help delay that late-race lactic buildup from running on tired legs. Also, recreational runners often do 5Ks/10Ks in training – beta-alanine clearly helps those, which might indirectly boost their speed that feeds into marathon performance. 
- It's not a top priority like carbs/caffeine – think of it as a potential ~0.5–1% improvement tool or simply a training enhancer. 

**Evidence in endurance context:** A meta-analysis noted **~2–3% endurance improvement in recreational athletes vs ~1% in high-level athletes** with beta-alanine (this is mostly from threshold/VO₂ max type efforts, not pure endurance). So a recreational runner might see, say, a slight improvement in a half-marathon time which could indirectly mean a better marathon if their threshold improved. Some studies on cyclists showed beta-alanine users could maintain higher power output in the latter part of a 30-min trial. Not dramatic, but it suggests reduced fatigue. 

**Safety:** Beta-alanine is safe aside from the flushing/tingling (which isn’t harmful, just odd). No known long-term negative effects – carnosine is natural in muscle and beneficial (some research even looks at it for anti-aging and diabetes). It’s not banned by WADA (carnosine is a normal body constituent). 

**Race day:** It doesn’t give an acute boost beyond what’s already loaded in muscle – so there’s no need to take extra on race morning (some might to keep levels up if they loaded early, but it’s the chronic load that matters). Ensure you still do all the usual fueling; beta-alanine doesn’t replace the need for carbs or anything.

**Bottom line:** **Beta-alanine is an optional supplement that can slightly improve high-intensity performance and potentially help you finish a marathon strong.** It’s more about **marginal gains and supporting intense training** than a direct game-changer on marathon day. If you love to optimize every detail, it’s worth considering. If you prefer minimal supplements, you can skip it and focus on the big nutrition pieces. If you do use it:
- Load at least 4–8 weeks, 4–6 g per day.
- Mind the tingles (split doses).
- Don’t expect miracles, but perhaps expect to feel a little less *burn* when pushing hard – which might translate to a better final 5K or an extra rep or two in training that then helps overall performance.

### Other Supplements – **Quick Mentions**  
- **Branched-Chain Amino Acids (BCAAs):** (Leucine, isoleucine, valine.) Taken during prolonged exercise, they might reduce central fatigue by competing with tryptophan uptake in the brain. Some ultra-runners use BCAA to stave off mental fatigue. For a marathon, evidence is weak that it improves performance. If you’re well-fueled with carbs and have sufficient protein generally, your body has plenty of BCAAs. BCAA supplements during a marathon likely have minimal effect (and pure BCAA in the stomach can cause GI upset for some). Focus on protein intake post-race instead (which supplies BCAAs). Possibly consider BCAAs (5–10 g) during an ultra or if doing fasted runs to protect muscle, but not essential for a marathon where fueling is happening. 
- **Glutamine:** An amino acid that might support immune function and gut integrity under stress. After a marathon, glutamine levels drop, which could contribute to post-race susceptibility to illness. Some studies show glutamine supplements (5–10 g post-race) might reduce infection rates. It’s not performance-enhancing, but if you often get sick after big races, you could take 5 g glutamine 2–3x/day for a week around the race. It’s very safe. Many recovery drink mixes include some glutamine. 
- **Antioxidant cocktails (Vitamin C/E, etc.):** We covered diet-based antioxidants. Some runners take a specialized antioxidant supplement (like a blend of vit C, E, beta-carotene, selenium, etc.) hoping to reduce muscle damage. Research is mixed – high-dose isolated antioxidants can blunt training adaptations if taken daily, but a moderate dose around race time might reduce DOMS. Best approach: rely on food antioxidants (berries, tart cherry juice, greens) rather than high-dose pills. Possibly supplement vitamin C (500 mg) for a few days after the race to help immune system and collagen repair – that’s fine. For daily training, stick to food or a standard multivitamin.
- **Tart Cherry Juice / Montmorency cherry:** Worth highlighting – not exactly a “performance” supplement, but many marathoners use tart cherry concentrate as a recovery aid. Consuming ~8–12 oz tart cherry juice or concentrate (in divided doses before and after race) has been shown to reduce inflammation and muscle soreness after hard exercise, and to improve recovery of strength. For example, some take 8 oz morning and night for 5 days around the marathon. It’s rich in anthocyanins (antioxidants). There’s evidence it may slightly improve endurance performance indirectly by improving recovery between heavy training days. Could be useful in a taper to ensure you’re fully recovered. It’s natural and safe – including it is a good idea, especially if you suffer from a lot of soreness. Many elites do this; recreational runners can buy tart cherry concentrate and mix with water. 
- **Collagen + Vitamin C:** As mentioned earlier, taking 5–10 g collagen or gelatin with ~50–100 mg vitamin C ~60 minutes before a short, easy exercise (like 15 min easy spin or jump rope) can increase collagen synthesis in tendons/ligaments. Over time this may strengthen connective tissue. Marathoners with tendon issues (Achilles, knee, plantar fascia) might use this protocol in training. It’s more of an injury prevention measure. Doesn’t directly improve marathon time, but fewer injuries = better training = better race. Many elites incorporate this; recreational runners can consider if they have nagging tendon pains.
- **Probiotics:** A healthy gut can reduce GI problems on race day and might reduce upper respiratory infections in heavy training. Some evidence indicates probiotic supplements (with strains like Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium) taken daily reduce incidence of traveler’s diarrhea and URTIs in endurance athletes. If you often get runner’s trots, improving gut flora (via yogurt, kefir, fermented foods or a pill) is worth trying. Some strains (like L. plantarum) have been linked to improved time to exhaustion in heat. Not a huge factor but beneficial for general health. At least consume fermented foods regularly. 
- **Sodium Phosphate:** Supplementing ~3–4 g/day of sodium phosphate for 3–6 days has been shown in some studies to increase VO₂max and 10K cycle time by 3–5% by improving oxygen delivery and 2,3-DPG in red blood cells. It’s lesser known but with decent evidence. It can cause GI issues or bloating in some (phosphate can upset stomach). Some elites quietly use it. Recreational runners can explore it if they want – it’s legal (phosphate is normal in diet). A protocol is e.g. 1 g sodium phosphate (tribasic) four times a day for 3 days. Ensure hydration because it can pull water into gut. I’d rank it below caffeine/nitrates in ease of use, but it’s an option for the *truly* detail-oriented athlete looking for every edge. Only attempt if practiced and if you responded well in a trial race.
- **Bicarbonate (baking soda):** Not recommended for marathon – primarily used by track athletes for 400–800m to buffer lactic acid. It causes major GI upset (diarrhea) in many. Marathon pace is too low intensity to justify that risk. Only note: some elites might use a tiny dose of sodium bicarb with sodium citrate pre-race to help with pH, but that’s rare. For 99.9% of marathoners, skip it – focus on beta-alanine for buffering instead (which works intracellularly without GI issues).
- **Adaptogens (Ashwagandha, Rhodiola):** These herbs are purported to help the body handle stress. Small studies: ashwagandha (600 mg/day) improved VO₂max in novice runners after 8 weeks; rhodiola (200–300 mg) can reduce RPE and fatigue. Evidence isn’t as strong as for caffeine/nitrates, but some athletes feel these give a subtle boost in training capacity or recovery. They are generally safe (ashwagandha can cause GI upset in some; rhodiola can cause activation/insomnia if taken late). If an athlete has anxiety, ashwagandha might help calm (which could indirectly help performance by improved sleep). These are more in the realm of personal trial. They’re not mainstream must-haves, but some elites use them under guidance. For a recreational runner curious to try: ensure they’re from a reputable source (herb supplements vary in quality), and test in base phase. They won’t directly shave minutes off your marathon, but might improve how you handle training stress or taper nerves.

**Keep perspective:** **No supplement can replace proper training and nutrition.** The *biggest performance factors* are: high carbohydrate availability, smart hydration, and appropriate pacing. Supplements are the 1–5% extras on top. **Elites** often have most macros/micros dialed in and thus find value in these 1–2% supplements. **Recreational runners** should first fix any deficiencies (iron, D, etc.) and nail their fueling strategy, then consider supplements like caffeine, beetroot, etc., for additional help.

**Key supplement stack for marathoners (priority order):** 
1. **Carbohydrate supplements** (gels, sports drink) – *essential fuel during race*, not “supplement” in the usual sense but absolutely crucial.
2. **Electrolytes (sodium)** – *essential for hydration*, use sports drinks or salt caps.
3. **Caffeine** – *proven ergogenic*, take ~3–4 mg/kg pre-race, maybe a boost mid-race.
4. **Beetroot juice (nitrates)** – *well-supported endurance aid*, use multi-day load finishing 2–3 hrs pre-race.
5. **Creatine** – *indirect aid*, optional but useful for power and training (use in training, discontinue pre-race to drop water).
6. **Beta-alanine** – *indirect aid*, optional for those seeking minor gains (load in training).
7. **Multivitamin** – *general health insurance*, recommended for heavy training to cover micros (with iron for women).
8. **Others** as needed (collagen for injury-prone, probiotics for gut issues, tart cherry for recovery, etc.).

## Putting It All Together: Sample Meal Plan and Race-Day Strategy

To illustrate, here’s a **sample plan for the 48 hours before and during a marathon** (for a hypothetical runner):

**48–24 Hours Pre-Race (Carb-Loading Period):**
- Emphasize **high-carb, low-fiber, moderate protein, low fat** meals. 
- *Breakfast (24 hrs out):* Pancakes with syrup and a little fruit juice (100+ g carbs, low fiber), egg whites (for a bit of protein), coffee (if normal). 
- *Lunch (20 hrs out):* White rice with a small chicken breast and teriyaki sauce (big portion of rice ~80 g carbs, minimal veggies), sports drink (for fluid + ~20 g carbs + sodium).
- *Snack (16 hrs out, mid-afternoon):* Bagel with honey (~60 g carbs), a handful of pretzels (~25 g, plus salt), water.
- *Dinner (12–14 hrs out, early evening):* Pasta with tomato sauce (large plate ~150 g carbs), small piece of grilled fish or tofu (~20 g protein), white bread (~30 g carbs) with a little butter, Gatorade to drink (~30 g carbs, lots of Na/K). Avoid heavy salad or high-fat meat. 
- *Evening snack (10 hrs out, if hungry):* Low-fat yogurt with a banana (~40 g carbs, 6 g protein) or a sports bar (~30 g carbs). Not too much fiber (choose a refined cereal bar or yogurt instead of raw fruit if fiber sensitive).
- Continue sipping fluids (water + some electrolyte beverage) to stay hydrated but not overly full.

**Race Morning:**
- **3–4 hours pre-start:** Eat a **familiar, carb-rich breakfast**. *Example (elite-style 4 hrs out):* 2 plain bagels (~100 g carbs) with jam (~30 g), 1 tbsp peanut butter (just for taste, minimal), a bottle of sports drink (~40 g carbs, 300 mg Na). Maybe 1 cup coffee. Total: ~170 g carbs, 10–15 g protein, low fat. *Example (recreational 2.5–3 hrs out):* 1.5 cups low-fiber cereal (e.g. corn flakes) with 1 cup skim milk (~60 g carbs, 8 g protein), 1 banana (~27 g), 8 oz orange juice (~26 g), water. Total: ~110 g carbs, 8 g protein. (If they can manage more, great – maybe add a slice of white toast with jelly for another 30 g). 
- **2–3 hrs pre-start:** Take **beetroot juice** (one concentrated shot or ~500 ml beet juice). (Coordinate this with breakfast timing: e.g. if breakfast 3 hrs out, drink beet juice 2 hrs out). No mouthwash after.
- **60–90 min pre-start:** Use the restroom (likely breakfast + coffee will prompt this around now). **Take caffeine**: e.g. a 200 mg caffeine pill or a small strong coffee. (If elite, maybe already had coffee at breakfast; if rec, maybe have coffee now if not earlier – just ensure you can hit the porta-potty one last time ~30 min later).
- **~15 min pre-start:** Optionally, consume a final quick carb (~25 g). This could be a gel (with or without 50–100 mg caffeine) + a few sips of water, or half a sports drink (~15 g) if you feel a bit hungry or want to top up. Many runners take a caffeinated gel now – it raises blood glucose and gives one more caffeine boost right as the race begins ([
            Nutrition and Supplement Update for the Endurance Athlete: Review and Recommendations - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6628334/#:~:text=theory%20%5B13%5D%2C%20a%20CNS,term%20%281%20h%29%20exercise)). If you are prone to blood sugar crashes, you can simply swish a carb drink and swallow a little (carb rinse has central benefit without large insulin spike). Most find an extra ~20 g at the start is helpful since you’ll burn through it quickly once running. 

**During the Marathon:**
- **Carbohydrate intake:** Target ~40–60 g carbs per hour (adjust per your plan). For example:
  - Mile 5 (~40 min): Gel #1 (about 20–25 g carbs, maybe non-caffeinated, 100 mg sodium). Wash down with water.
  - Mile 10 (~80 min): Gel #2 (another ~20–25 g). If taking 4 total, this could be a good point for one with caffeine (say 50 mg) to maintain levels.
  - Alternate plan: Instead of strict schedule, some take gels at 45 min, 1:30, 2:15, 3:00 etc. – any consistent spacing works.
  - If you prefer liquids: drink ~8 oz sports drink (≈15 g carb) at each aid station (~every 20 min) – over an hour that might total ~3 cups = 45 g. Or combine: sports drink at some stations, gels at others.
- **Fluid/Electrolyte intake:** E.g. **Drink 4–8 oz (~100–200 ml) at each aid station**, ideally a sports drink to get sodium. If you’re using course-provided Gatorade: each 6 oz (~180 ml) cup ~ provides 14 g carb, 110 mg sodium. You might grab a cup of Gatorade and a water each time – drink the Gatorade, sip water if needed (or use water to wash down gels). Aim for ~400–800 ml per hour (less if it’s cool and you’re a light sweater, more if hot/heavy sweat). **Take salt supplement if needed:** e.g. at halfway (~1:45 in for a ~3.5 hr runner), swallow one salt capsule (~200–300 mg sodium) if cramp-prone or very sweaty. Or eat a few pretzels provided on course around mile 18–20 for salt + some carbs. 
- **Caffeine top-up:** Many runners plan a **caffeinated gel around mile 18–20** (~2.5–3 hrs in). This ~20–40 mg helps fight late-race mental fog. If you had 200 mg pre-race at 7:30, by 10:30 a 40–50 mg boost helps extend caffeine’s effect toward the finish. If you brought caffeine gum, you could chew a piece at mile 22 for a final kick (e.g. Run Gum 1 piece ~50 mg).
- **Listen to your body:** Drink to thirst (but do make use of each station, even a couple sips). If you sense slight cramp twinges, prioritize grabbing Gatorade or take that salt cap a bit sooner. If you’re struggling to get gels down (some people gag late in race), switch to sipping more sports drink for carbs, or take smaller bites of energy chews more frequently rather than a whole gel at once. Having tried everything in training will let you troubleshoot on the fly.
- **Elites** will have their own bottles prepared (usually ~300 ml of ~8% carb solution with ~300–500 mg Na each, taken ~every 5K). They may take an extra gel if needed or a caffeine chew late, but their fueling is often all liquid. **Recreational** runners rely on aid stations and what they carry – which is why practicing with what the race provides is smart (so you’re used to Gatorade Endurance formula or whatever is on course). 

**Post-Finish (Recovery):**
- **Immediately (within 30 min):** Rehydrate and refuel **while celebrating!** Aim for ~20–30 g protein and ~50–100 g carbs plus electrolytes in the first 30–60 min post-race. Practical: drink a bottle of the provided recovery drink or chocolate milk (12–20 g protein, 20–30 g carbs) and eat the banana + pretzels from the finish bag (30 g carbs, some potassium, ~300 mg sodium). Or grab that bagel at the finish line and a cup of sports drink. Anything is fine as long as it has some carbs and protein. **Elites** often have a prepared recovery shake waiting, and maybe an IV if severely dehydrated. **Recreational** runners should make use of finish line food – don’t skip it because you “feel nauseous”; try to get at least a sports drink and some bites of food in to start refueling. 
- **Next 2 hours:** Get a balanced meal with plenty of carbs and protein (e.g. a burrito with rice, chicken, beans, and veggies – a nice mix of carbs, 30+ g protein, and salt). Continue sipping fluids (water + electrolytes). If you crave something, honor it (many crave salt – have some soup or chips; others crave sugar – that’s fine too, your body wants carbs). Just ensure protein isn’t neglected (some marathoners don’t feel like eating much – a protein smoothie might go down easier in that case).
- **Micros in recovery:** Consider an anti-inflammatory like tart cherry juice or a serving of berries to help reduce soreness. Maintain a higher vitamin C intake for a few days (lots of fruits/veggies or a 500 mg supplement) to support immune function (post-marathon immune suppression is common). Continue taking any needed supplements (iron, etc.) as normal. **Elites** often have physiotherapy, NormaTec boots, etc., but nutritionally they do the same fundamentals: rehydrate, refuel (they might have a nutritionist plan a specific recovery meal).
- **Rest of day:** If it’s a morning race, nibble throughout the day – small snacks every 1–2 hours can be easier than huge meals if your appetite is off. Focus on carbs to restore glycogen (aim ~1.0–1.2 g/kg/hour of carbs for first 4 hours post-race if you need to recover quickly). Also include protein ~0.25 g/kg (15–20 g) each time you eat to keep muscle repair ongoing. Drink enough to pee pale by evening (you’ll likely have taken care of this by then). Enjoy a treat – you earned it – just also give your body what it needs (celebratory beers are fine in moderation, but remember alcohol doesn’t rehydrate – chase that beer with water or have it after you’ve gotten some recovery nutrition in).

Finally, **the key summary** of nutritional strategies for marathon running:

### Key Takeaways and Recommendations

- **Emphasize Carbohydrates:** They are the *marathoner’s primary fuel*. Aim for **~60–70% of calories from carbs** during heavy training and especially in the 2–3 days before the race (carb-loading with ~8–12 g/kg/day). Include carb sources at every meal and snack – *don’t fear refined carbs in the pre-race period* if they help you increase intake. Ensure **pre-run and race-day meals are carb-rich** (e.g. 100+ g for breakfast if 3–4 hrs pre-race), and **fuel during the race** with ~30–60 g carbs/hour via gels, drinks, etc.. High carbs = high glycogen = sustained pace and delayed fatigue. *Elite vs Rec:* Both need high carbs; elites might push to the upper range (10–12 g/kg) for supercompensation, while recreational runners aim at least 7–10 g/kg in final days. **Recommendation:** Plan your carb-loading meals – e.g. pasta, rice, bread, potatoes, sports drinks – and practice your during-race fueling in long runs to ensure you can consume ~4 gels and sports drink without issue.

- **Prioritize Protein for Recovery:** Consume **~1.2–1.6 g/kg/day of protein** spread over the day. This supports muscle repair from training and helps prevent injury. Include **20–30 g high-quality protein** at each meal (lean meat, poultry, fish, eggs, dairy, soy, legumes), and **~15–25 g protein soon after runs** (within 30–60 min) for optimal recovery. Adequate protein will reduce soreness and help preserve lean muscle during high mileage. *Elite vs Rec:* Differences are minor – both should do this. Many elites hit ~1.5 g/kg; recreational runners often under-eat protein, so consciously adding protein (a recovery shake, an extra Greek yogurt, etc.) can markedly improve how you feel. **Recommendation:** Make a recovery shake with ~20 g whey + 40–60 g carbs after long/hard runs – this simple habit can speed recovery. Ensure every meal has a solid protein source (3–4 oz of meat or 1 cup beans or 3 eggs, etc.). This consistent protein will keep you stronger through the training cycle.

- **Don’t Fear Fats (but time them wisely):** Include **healthy fats (~20–30% of calories)** daily for hormone production and to absorb nutrients. Foods like avocados, nuts, seeds, olive oil, and oily fish provide anti-inflammatory omega-3s – beneficial for joint and muscle health. However, **avoid high-fat meals right before running or racing** (they slow digestion and can cause GI issues) ([
            International Society of Sports Nutrition Position Stand: nutritional considerations for single-stage ultra-marathon training and racing - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6839090/#:~:text=the%20event%20,gut%20discomfort%20during%20the%20race)). Keep the pre-race dinner and breakfast low in fat (e.g. choose tomato-based pasta sauce over alfredo, small amounts of nut butter not a huge amount). During carb-loading, reducing fat intake helps you eat more carbs without overeating calories. *Elite vs Rec:* Both need some fat – elites often include nuts, nut butter, olive oil in their diet except in final 1–2 days when they cut fat to load carbs. Recreational runners should similarly not go fat-free (that can lead to fatigue and micronutrient deficiencies), but might reduce added fats slightly in taper while focusing on carbs. **Recommendation:** Eat a source of unsaturated fat at most meals (e.g. a handful of nuts, drizzle of olive oil, quarter of an avocado). This will usually meet your needs (~70–80 g/day). Leading up to key workouts or races, shift to more carbs and less fat, but resume normal fat intake afterward. Balanced fat intake keeps your immune system strong and inflammation in check during training.

- **Stay Hydrated and Replace Electrolytes (especially Sodium):** **Dehydration or hyponatremia can ruin a marathon** – prevent both by managing fluid and salt. **Drink to satisfy thirst** throughout training and on race day. **Include electrolytes (primarily sodium)** in fluids during long runs and the race – use sports drinks or take salt capsules (~200–300 mg Na each hour if using only water). Avoid chugging plain water in large volumes; instead, consume sports drink or water + salty snacks to maintain sodium balance. **Pre-race:** the day before, consume something salty (pretzels, broth, salted pretzels) and ~500 mL of electrolyte drink in the evening and again in the morning. **During race:** aim ~400–800 mL fluid per hour (adjust for conditions) with ~300–600 mg sodium/hr. E.g. ~1 cup (~240 mL) Gatorade + 1 cup water each hour plus a few pretzels or a salt stick. *Elite vs Rec:* Elites execute highly individualized hydration plans but the principle is the same: they target ~fluid loss <2% body weight### Summary: Key Nutrition Strategies for Marathon Runners

- **Carbohydrates:** Make carbs the foundation of your diet. Aim for ~60–70% of calories from carbs during heavy training. Fuel up before runs (1–4 g/kg, 1–4 hours prior) and take in 30–60 g carbs per hour during long runs and the marathon (energy gels, sports drinks). In race week, **carbo-load with 8–12 g/kg/day** for 2–3 days to maximize glycogen. This applies to both elites and recreational runners – it’s the #1 factor for endurance performance.

- **Protein:** Consume **1.2–1.6 g/kg of protein daily** for muscle repair. Distribute protein evenly (20–30 g per meal) and **include protein + carbs within 30–60 min post-run** to speed recovery. High protein intake (with adequate calories) helps reduce injuries and maintains muscle mass in marathon training. Everyone needs it – many recreational runners should increase protein intake to meet these targets.

- **Fats:** Eat **moderate healthy fats (~20–30% of calories)**. Focus on unsaturated fats (olive oil, nuts, avocado, fatty fish) for anti-inflammatory benefits. Don’t cut fat too low – it’s vital for hormones and nutrient absorption. However, **limit high-fat foods right before and during running** to avoid GI upset ([
            International Society of Sports Nutrition Position Stand: nutritional considerations for single-stage ultra-marathon training and racing - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6839090/#:~:text=the%20event%20,gut%20discomfort%20during%20the%20race)). Both elites and non-elites should include fat for health and satiety, but timing is key (e.g. low-fat meals around key runs).

- **Fluids & Electrolytes:** **Hydrate according to thirst and replace electrolytes, especially sodium**. In training and on race day, use sports drinks or salty foods to ingest ~300–600 mg sodium per hour along with fluids. Start the race well-hydrated (urine light-colored) but avoid overdrinking water – include electrolytes to prevent hyponatremia. A good guideline is ~400–800 mL fluid with electrolytes per hour (adjust for heat and individual sweat rate). Recreational runners often need to consciously take sodium (via sports drinks or salt caps) since they’re out there longer. Elites also plan aggressive hydration, especially in heat. *Key:* In the marathon, **drink a mix of water + sports drink at aid stations rather than water alone**, and consider a salt capsule mid-race if you’re a heavy sweater or cramp-prone.

- **Micronutrients:** Cover your bases with a varied diet:
  - **Iron:** Essential! Eat iron-rich foods daily (red meat, spinach, beans, fortified cereal) and pair with vitamin C for absorption ([
            Exploring the Relationship between Micronutrients and Athletic Performance: A Comprehensive Scientific Systematic Review of the Literature in Sports Medicine - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10302780/#:~:text=Iron%20deficiency%2C%20whether%20combined%20with,Dairy%20products%2C%20sardines%20and%20salmon)). Women and high-mileage runners should monitor iron status – supplement if ferritin is low. Avoiding iron deficiency is crucial for both elites and recreational runners (fatigue and poor performance result otherwise).
  - **Magnesium:** Include nuts, whole grains, greens for magnesium (helps prevent cramps and aids energy production). If you experience cramps or poor sleep, consider ~200–400 mg magnesium supplement.
  - **Calcium & Vitamin D:** Ensure ~1000 mg calcium/day (dairy or fortified alternatives) and adequate vitamin D (sun or ~1000–2000 IU supplement) to support bone health. This is vital for female runners to prevent stress fractures.
  - **Zinc, B-vitamins, etc.:** A balanced diet with lean meats, whole grains, and vegetables covers these. Vegetarians should take B12 and maybe zinc. If your diet is restricted or you’re in heavy training, a **daily multivitamin** is wise to plug any gaps (common practice among elites and a good idea for recreational runners too).

- **Proven Supplements:** 
  - **Caffeine:** Perhaps the most effective legal performance booster. Take **3–6 mg/kg 45–60 min pre-race** (e.g. ~200 mg for a 70 kg runner). It will lower perceived effort and improve endurance. Consider a smaller caffeine dose (e.g. caffeinated gel or energy chew) in the later miles for a mental/physical boost. *Practice in training!* Nearly all elites use caffeine; recreational runners can benefit similarly – just don’t overdo it (excess can cause GI distress or jitters).
  - **Beetroot Juice (Nitrates):** Take ~500 ml beet juice or one concentrated shot (~6–8 mmol nitrate) 2–3 hours before the race. Alternatively, start a 2–3 day load of nitrates (one shot each day + one on race morning). This can improve running economy and stamina by enhancing oxygen use efficiency. It’s safe and can be quite helpful, especially for recreational runners. Try it in training first. 
  - **Carbohydrate supplements during race:** Not usually called “supplements,” but energy gels, chews, and sports drinks are essential tools – plan to take ~4–6 gels (or equivalent) over the marathon and chase with water. Choose brands and flavors you’ve tested (both elites and age-groupers stick to what works for them). 
  - **Creatine (optional):** If you want to improve your sprint capacity and training power, consider creatine. Use 3–5 g/day in training (and optionally discontinue ~3 weeks pre-race to lose water weight). It can help maintain strength through high mileage and give you a stronger finishing kick. It’s more useful if you also do strength training or have tactical surges. If weight gain concerns you or you haven’t tried it, it’s okay to skip – focus on caffeine/nitrates which act more directly on endurance.
  - **Beta-Alanine (optional):** If you’re looking for marginal gains, loading with beta-alanine (4–6 g/day for 4–8 weeks) can increase muscle buffering capacity. This may slightly improve your lactate threshold and help with late-race surges or high-intensity training. It’s not a primary need, but some elites and dedicated amateurs use it. Only worthwhile if you’ve already nailed the fundamentals and want that extra 1%. 

- **Avoid unproven or risky supplements:** There’s no magic pill – avoid anything not backed by research or not approved for sport (e.g. excessive stimulants, “fat burners,” etc. – at best they do nothing, at worst they can harm or cause a doping violation). Stick to the well-researched aids above and a strong diet. 

In summary, **the optimal diet for marathon running is high in carbohydrates, includes sufficient protein spaced through the day, and moderate in healthy fats.** It ensures key micronutrients (iron, magnesium, etc.) are abundant. On race day, **carb-load, hydrate with electrolytes, and use caffeine** (and possibly beet juice) to enhance performance. **Elites and recreational runners differ mainly in quantity and fine-tuning, not in the basic nutritional principles.** By following these guidelines – fueling and refueling properly, staying micronutrient-replete, and leveraging proven supplements – you’ll be giving yourself the best chance to run your strongest 26.2, whether you’re chasing a podium or a personal best. **Train hard, eat smart, run fast!**

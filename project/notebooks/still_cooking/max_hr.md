TLDR:
- HR<sub>max</sub> standard deviation ~7-11 beats/min. Genetics is the dominant factor. It's independent of sex and physical activity.
- 95% of individuals fall roughly within ±20 bpm of the age-predicted HR<sub>max</sub>.
- HR<sub>max</sub> = 208 - 0.7 * age

# Maximum Heart Rate Variability and Training Intensity Zones

## Variation in HR<sub>max</sub> Among Same-Age Individuals  
Individual maximum heart rate (HR<sub>max</sub>) can vary widely even between people of the same age. **Age is the primary determinant of HR<sub>max</sub>**, with HR<sub>max</sub> declining as age increases (approximately 0.7 beats per year) ([Age-predicted maximal heart rate revisited - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11153730/#:~:text=Results%3A%20%20In%20the%20meta,in%20habitual%20physical%20activity%20levels)). However, there is **substantial person-to-person variability** around this trend. In a large study of 514 adults, the standard deviation of HR<sub>max</sub> at a given age was **~7–11 beats/min** ([PII: S0735-1097(00)01054-8](https://webs.um.es/jlyuste/documts/tanaka.pdf#:~:text=inversely%20related%20to%20age%20in,6%203%20age%29%20subjects)). This means that for two healthy individuals of the same age, one could have an HR<sub>max</sub> 10 bpm higher or lower than the other purely due to normal variation. In practical terms, **95% of individuals fall roughly within ±20 bpm of the age-predicted HR<sub>max</sub>**, and even larger differences are possible ([PII: S0735-1097(00)01054-8](https://webs.um.es/jlyuste/documts/tanaka.pdf#:~:text=inversely%20related%20to%20age%20in,6%203%20age%29%20subjects)) ([PII: S0735-1097(00)01054-8](https://webs.um.es/jlyuste/documts/tanaka.pdf#:~:text=was%20compared%20with%20the%20traditional,20%20beats%2Fmin%20for)). For example, at age 70 the traditional formula underestimates true HR<sub>max</sub> by ~10 beats on average, and for some older adults the error can exceed **20 beats/min** ([PII: S0735-1097(00)01054-8](https://webs.um.es/jlyuste/documts/tanaka.pdf#:~:text=was%20compared%20with%20the%20traditional,20%20beats%2Fmin%20for)). This wide confidence interval highlights that **two people aged, say, 40 could have HR<sub>max</sub> values differing by several dozen beats** and still be normal.

Importantly, this variation is **not easily predicted by basic demographics or fitness level**. Research has found that HR<sub>max</sub> is **independent of sex and habitual physical activity** (training status) in healthy individuals ([Age-predicted maximal heart rate revisited - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11153730/#:~:text=Results%3A%20%20In%20the%20meta,in%20habitual%20physical%20activity%20levels)). In other words, being an endurance-trained athlete or sedentary does not significantly change one’s maximal heart rate (though training affects submaximal heart response, as discussed later). Instead, **genetic factors play a major role** in HR<sub>max</sub> differences. Family and twin studies indicate that about **40–45% of the variability in HR<sub>max</sub> is heritable** ([
            Measured Maximal Heart Rates Compared to Commonly Used Age-Based Prediction Equations in the Heritage Family Study - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3935487/#:~:text=A%20biological%20explanation%20for%20the,the%20ANS%20is%20known%20to)). For instance, the HERITAGE Family Study reported heritability estimates of **39% in Black families and 44% in White families** for measured HR<sub>max</sub> ([
            Measured Maximal Heart Rates Compared to Commonly Used Age-Based Prediction Equations in the Heritage Family Study - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3935487/#:~:text=A%20biological%20explanation%20for%20the,the%20ANS%20is%20known%20to)). This suggests nearly half of the difference in HR<sub>max</sub> between individuals can be attributed to genetics. The mechanisms are likely related to the autonomic nervous system and cardiac physiology – e.g. genetic differences affecting intrinsic heart rate or sensitivity to adrenaline ([
            Measured Maximal Heart Rates Compared to Commonly Used Age-Based Prediction Equations in the Heritage Family Study - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3935487/#:~:text=the%20same%20between%20ethnic%20groups,that%20young%20Blacks%20may%20experience)). Other factors (like medications, altitude, or cardiac conditions) can also influence an individual’s HR<sub>max</sub>, but in a healthy population the **age and genetic makeup are the dominant factors** determining HR<sub>max</sub>.

## Accuracy of Common HR<sub>max</sub> Prediction Formulas  
Because of the need to estimate HR<sub>max</sub> without maximal testing, numerous age-based formulas exist – the most famous being **“220 − age”** (often attributed to Fox and Haskell). In practice, **220−age is only a rough estimate** and was derived informally from limited data ([PII: S0735-1097(00)01054-8](https://webs.um.es/jlyuste/documts/tanaka.pdf#:~:text=reports%20proposing%20the%20220%202,cardiovascular%20disease%20who%20smoked%20and%2For)). It tends to **overestimate HR<sub>max</sub> in young adults and underestimate in older adults** ([PII: S0735-1097(00)01054-8](https://webs.um.es/jlyuste/documts/tanaka.pdf#:~:text=was%20compared%20with%20the%20traditional,20%20beats%2Fmin%20for)). A 40-year-old’s true HR<sub>max</sub> often aligns with 220−age, but by age 70 the 220−age formula underestimates actual HR<sub>max</sub> by ~10 bpm on average ([PII: S0735-1097(00)01054-8](https://webs.um.es/jlyuste/documts/tanaka.pdf#:~:text=was%20compared%20with%20the%20traditional,20%20beats%2Fmin%20for)). Modern studies have developed refined equations: for example, **Tanaka et al. (2001)** found **HR<sub>max</sub> = 208 − 0.7 × age** fit healthy adults better ([Age-predicted maximal heart rate revisited - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11153730/#:~:text=Results%3A%20%20In%20the%20meta,in%20habitual%20physical%20activity%20levels)). Similarly, others have proposed formulas like **207 − 0.7×age** or **209 − 0.7×age**, which are virtually identical to Tanaka’s result ([Age-predicted maximal heart rate revisited - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11153730/#:~:text=Results%3A%20%20In%20the%20meta,in%20habitual%20physical%20activity%20levels)). These newer formulas correct the bias at older ages (showing that 220−age was too low for seniors) ([PII: S0735-1097(00)01054-8](https://webs.um.es/jlyuste/documts/tanaka.pdf#:~:text=was%20compared%20with%20the%20traditional,20%20beats%2Fmin%20for)).

Despite improved equations, the **individual variability remains high**. Prediction formulas have a fairly large error margin when applied to an individual. Typically the **standard error of estimate is on the order of 10 beats/min**, and 95% of individuals will be about ±20 bpm of the predicted value ([PII: S0735-1097(00)01054-8](https://webs.um.es/jlyuste/documts/tanaka.pdf#:~:text=inversely%20related%20to%20age%20in,6%203%20age%29%20subjects)) ([PII: S0735-1097(00)01054-8](https://webs.um.es/jlyuste/documts/tanaka.pdf#:~:text=was%20compared%20with%20the%20traditional,20%20beats%2Fmin%20for)). In one validation study, the classic “220−age” formula had a **root-mean-square error ~11.6 bpm**, with 95% limits of agreement about **−23 to +22 bpm** versus measured HR<sub>max</sub> ([
            Accuracy of Commonly Used Age-Predicted Maximal Heart Rate Equations - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7523886/#:~:text=Female%20179,74)). Newer formulas (e.g. Tanaka’s 208−0.7×age) have **similar accuracy**, with errors on the order of ±10–12 bpm ([
            Accuracy of Commonly Used Age-Predicted Maximal Heart Rate Equations - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7523886/#:~:text=%28%E2%88%9227,30)). In other words, even the best age-based formula can be off by **10–15 beats for an individual (and potentially >20 bpm in some cases)** ([PII: S0735-1097(00)01054-8](https://webs.um.es/jlyuste/documts/tanaka.pdf#:~:text=with%20further%20increases%20in%20age,20%20beats%2Fmin%20for)). All formulas show minimal average bias (no formula consistently overshoots or undershoots across a broad population), but **wide confidence intervals** – a recent analysis noted the average range between upper and lower agreement limits was ~44 bpm for several common formulas ([
            Accuracy of Commonly Used Age-Predicted Maximal Heart Rate Equations - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7523886/#:~:text=limits%20of%20agreement%20for%20the,Additionally)). This means **age alone is an imperfect predictor of HR<sub>max</sub>**, and one should expect large individual differences around the formula value. Whenever possible, measuring one’s own HR<sub>max</sub> (via a graded exercise test) is preferable for precision. Nonetheless, age-predicted HR<sub>max</sub> is a useful starting point, just with the understanding that **“your mileage may vary”** considerably ([
            Accuracy of Commonly Used Age-Predicted Maximal Heart Rate Equations - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7523886/#:~:text=female%20%28201,with%20HRmax%20measured%20with%20the)).

*Clinical note:* The underestimation of HR<sub>max</sub> in older adults by the 220−age formula has practical implications. It can cause under-training if exercise intensity targets are based on a falsely low HR<sub>max</sub>, or premature termination of stress tests if 85% of the predicted HR<sub>max</sub> is reached while the individual may still be below true max ([PII: S0735-1097(00)01054-8](https://webs.um.es/jlyuste/documts/tanaka.pdf#:~:text=well,derived%20target%20heart%20rate%20prescriptions)) ([PII: S0735-1097(00)01054-8](https://webs.um.es/jlyuste/documts/tanaka.pdf#:~:text=established%20by%20conventional%20maximal%20exercise,example%2C%20at%20age%2070%20years)). Updated formulas like Tanaka’s mitigate this issue by giving slightly higher predicted HR<sub>max</sub> in older age ranges ([PII: S0735-1097(00)01054-8](https://webs.um.es/jlyuste/documts/tanaka.pdf#:~:text=was%20compared%20with%20the%20traditional,20%20beats%2Fmin%20for)), but the **inherent variability means even these should be applied with caution** on an individual level.

## Heart Rate at Different Running Intensities  
**Well-trained endurance runners** can typically sustain a higher percentage of their HR<sub>max</sub> for a given effort than less-trained runners, because training raises the threshold at which the body accumulates lactate and fatigues. 

The table below summarizes *typical heart rate intensities* for different running categories, with rough ranges for trained vs. recreational runners:

| Running Intensity                        | %HR<sub>max</sub> – Trained Runners (approx.)            | %HR<sub>max</sub> – Recreational Runners (approx.)       |
|------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| **Sprint efforts** (e.g. 100–400 m)      | ~90–100% by end of sprint (heart rate approaches max near finish)<br>*(Short sprints may not allow HR to fully peak during the effort due to their brevity.)* | ~90–100% by end of sprint (similar relative peak; very brief sprints still elicit a rapid rise in HR) |
| **Lactate tolerance** (800 m – 1500 m race pace) | ~95–100% HR<sub>max</sub> during final stages;<br>Average ~90%+ over race (near maximal aerobic effort) | ~90–100% HR<sub>max</sub> by the finish as well;<br>Average may be slightly lower (~85–95%) if the race lasts >3–4 minutes for slower runners |
| **Intensive aerobic** (VO₂max intervals / 5000 m pace) | ~90–95% HR<sub>max</sub> on average in a 5K race ([What should your heart rate be during a 5K race? - Canadian Running Magazine](https://runningmagazine.ca/sections/training/what-should-your-heart-rate-be-during-a-5k-race/#:~:text=During%20the%20first%20two%20kilometres,ensure%20you%20don%E2%80%99t%20burn%20out));<br>Often reaches ~98–100% at end of an all-out 5K (12–20 min effort) | ~85–95% HR<sub>max</sub> during a 5K (varies with fitness and race time). Slower/less fit runners (taking 25–30 min) may need to stay ~85–90% early and can hit ~95–100% in the final kick. |
| **Threshold training – Interval** (10,000 m race pace) | ~85–92% HR<sub>max</sub> (near lactate threshold). Well-trained runners’ lactate threshold is high, often **~88–92% HR<sub>max</sub>** ([Ask the Coaches: Heart Rate for a 10K | Runner's World](https://www.runnersworld.com/advanced/a20823668/ask-the-coaches-heart-rate-for-a-10k/#:~:text=For%20a%2010K%2C%20I%20usually,92%20percent%20MHR)). An all-out 10K (~30–60 min) might average ~90% HR<sub>max</sub>. | ~80–88% HR<sub>max</sub> (moderate runners’ threshold occurs at a lower %HR<sub>max</sub>). A less-trained runner might race 10K at ~85% HR<sub>max</sub> on average, with heart rate drifting toward ~90% late in the race ([Ask the Coaches: Heart Rate for a 10K | Runner's World](https://www.runnersworld.com/advanced/a20823668/ask-the-coaches-heart-rate-for-a-10k/#:~:text=For%20a%2010K%2C%20I%20usually,92%20percent%20MHR)). |
| **Threshold training – Continuous** (marathon pace) | ~80–85% HR<sub>max</sub> for elite or well-trained marathoners over 2–3 hours (just below anaerobic threshold) ([Marathon Heart Rate: What's A Typical MHR During The Race?](https://marathonhandbook.com/marathon-heart-rate/#:~:text=For%20example%2C%20a%20runner%20trying,of%20max%20heart%20rate%20range)). Some highly trained individuals even sustain ~85–90%. **Average observed in one study: ~89% HR<sub>max</sub>** ([

        ](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9566186/#:~:text=All%20therunners%2015008%2010.5%2063,4)). | ~70–80% HR<sub>max</sub> for recreational marathoners (who run longer, 4+ hours). Many coaches recommend ~65–80% HR<sub>max</sub> for marathon pacing to avoid premature fatigue ([Marathon Heart Rate: What's A Typical MHR During The Race?](https://marathonhandbook.com/marathon-heart-rate/#:~:text=One%20study%20suggested%20that%20most,of%20your%20maximal%20heart%20rate)). (In a sample of recreational male marathoners, average race HR ranged from **82% to 96% HR<sub>max</sub>** – a very wide individual variation ([Marathon Heart Rate: What's A Typical MHR During The Race?](https://marathonhandbook.com/marathon-heart-rate/#:~:text=percentage%20of%20VO2%20max%20in,of%20different%20running%20ability%20levels)).) |
| **Easy to Moderate continuous running** (conversational pace, long runs, recovery runs) | ~60–75% HR<sub>max</sub> (easy aerobic zone). Training in this zone is typical for high-volume base training (Zone 1–2) ([Running Heart Rate: What’s Safe and What’s Too High?](https://www.healthline.com/health/running-heart-rate#:~:text=,of%20maximum%20heart%20rate)) ([Running Heart Rate: What’s Safe and What’s Too High?](https://www.healthline.com/health/running-heart-rate#:~:text=Your%20ideal%20target%20heart%20rate,rate%2C%20while%20running%20is%2070%E2%80%9385)). A well-trained runner may have a lower HR for the same pace due to higher stroke volume. | ~60–75% HR<sub>max</sub> (similar % as trained for truly easy runs). However, an unfit individual’s “easy” jog might subjectively feel harder and could push toward the upper end of this range. Guidelines often cite ~50–75% HR<sub>max</sub> for light jogging ([Running Heart Rate: What’s Safe and What’s Too High?](https://www.healthline.com/health/running-heart-rate#:~:text=Your%20ideal%20target%20heart%20rate,rate%2C%20while%20running%20is%2070%E2%80%9385)). |

**Sources:** The above ranges are synthesized from exercise physiology guidelines and studies. For example, lactate (anaerobic) threshold typically occurs around **83–87% of VO₂max, corresponding to roughly 85% of HR<sub>max</sub>**, in moderately trained individuals ([Marathon Heart Rate: What's A Typical MHR During The Race?](https://marathonhandbook.com/marathon-heart-rate/#:~:text=Studies%20suggest%20that%20the%20anaerobic,of%20your%20maximum%20heart%20rate)). With training, threshold can rise to ~90% HR<sub>max</sub> ([Marathon Heart Rate: What's A Typical MHR During The Race?](https://marathonhandbook.com/marathon-heart-rate/#:~:text=However%2C%20training%20can%20improve%20this,intensity%20exercise)), allowing trained runners to sustain ~90%+ HR<sub>max</sub> at 10K pace ([Ask the Coaches: Heart Rate for a 10K | Runner's World](https://www.runnersworld.com/advanced/a20823668/ask-the-coaches-heart-rate-for-a-10k/#:~:text=For%20a%2010K%2C%20I%20usually,92%20percent%20MHR)). Marathon efforts usually stay in the high-aerobic zone (well below true HR<sub>max</sub>). Coaches often advise **65–80% HR<sub>max</sub> for marathon pace** ([Marathon Heart Rate: What's A Typical MHR During The Race?](https://marathonhandbook.com/marathon-heart-rate/#:~:text=One%20study%20suggested%20that%20most,of%20your%20maximal%20heart%20rate)), but field data show variability – faster racers (with higher fitness) tend to hold a higher fraction of HR<sub>max</sub> than slower runners for the same event ([Marathon Heart Rate: What's A Typical MHR During The Race?](https://marathonhandbook.com/marathon-heart-rate/#:~:text=For%20example%2C%20a%20runner%20trying,of%20max%20heart%20rate%20range)) ([Marathon Heart Rate: What's A Typical MHR During The Race?](https://marathonhandbook.com/marathon-heart-rate/#:~:text=percentage%20of%20VO2%20max%20in,of%20different%20running%20ability%20levels)). Notably, in a study of 10 male runners of mixed ability, the **average marathon HR ranged from 82% to 96% of HR<sub>max</sub>** among individuals ([Marathon Heart Rate: What's A Typical MHR During The Race?](https://marathonhandbook.com/marathon-heart-rate/#:~:text=percentage%20of%20VO2%20max%20in,of%20different%20running%20ability%20levels)), illustrating the large differences in how hard people push themselves. Generally, **trained athletes can race at a higher % of HR<sub>max</sub> for a given distance** because their cardiovascular and metabolic thresholds are higher. An elite marathoner might sustain ~85–88% HR<sub>max</sub> for 2 hours, whereas a novice running for 5 hours might stay near 70% to avoid overheating or bonking ([Marathon Heart Rate: What's A Typical MHR During The Race?](https://marathonhandbook.com/marathon-heart-rate/#:~:text=For%20example%2C%20a%20runner%20trying,of%20max%20heart%20rate%20range)).

It’s worth emphasizing that **heart rate lags behind instantaneous effort**. In very short maximal sprints (100–200 m, <30 s), the heart rate may not reach its true maximum by the finish, though it will climb rapidly. By ~1 minute into an all-out run (e.g. 400 m), most athletes reach or near HR<sub>max</sub> as cardiovascular demand catches up. Thus, even “anaerobic” efforts elicit near-max heart rates if they last long enough. Across sprint and middle-distance events up to 1500 m, athletes of all levels usually finish with heart rates at ~95–100% of their max. For longer runs (5K, 10K, etc.), heart rate typically **starts at a lower % and increases throughout** – runners often begin a 5K around 80–85% HR<sub>max</sub> in the first kilometer and end at ~100% in the final kick ([What should your heart rate be during a 5K race? - Canadian Running Magazine](https://runningmagazine.ca/sections/training/what-should-your-heart-rate-be-during-a-5k-race/#:~:text=During%20the%20first%20two%20kilometres,ensure%20you%20don%E2%80%99t%20burn%20out)). A controlled 10K might be run near lactate threshold (~85% HR<sub>max</sub>), then creep into the 90s% in the later miles ([Ask the Coaches: Heart Rate for a 10K | Runner's World](https://www.runnersworld.com/advanced/a20823668/ask-the-coaches-heart-rate-for-a-10k/#:~:text=For%20a%2010K%2C%20I%20usually,92%20percent%20MHR)). **Easy runs**, on the other hand, are kept well below threshold – often in the 60–75% HR<sub>max</sub> range – to develop aerobic base without undue fatigue ([Running Heart Rate: What’s Safe and What’s Too High?](https://www.healthline.com/health/running-heart-rate#:~:text=,of%20maximum%20heart%20rate)) ([Running Heart Rate: What’s Safe and What’s Too High?](https://www.healthline.com/health/running-heart-rate#:~:text=Your%20ideal%20target%20heart%20rate,rate%2C%20while%20running%20is%2070%E2%80%9385)).

## %HR<sub>max</sub> vs. %HRR (Heart Rate Reserve) – What’s the Difference?  

%HR<sub>max</sub> is simpler and commonly used, while %HRR is more individualized. Both are valid ways to gauge intensity, but %HRR provides a more consistent measure of **relative effort** across individuals by factoring in the resting heart rate. Knowing how to use both measures allows athletes and practitioners to better tailor training intensity to the individual’s cardiovascular profile.


**%HR<sub>max</sub>** is the fraction of your maximal heart rate at which you’re working. The formula is:  
> *%HR<sub>max</sub> = (Exercise HR / HR<sub>max</sub>) × 100%*.  
  
  For example, exercising at 150 bpm for someone with a 200 bpm max is 75% HR<sub>max</sub>. This metric doesn’t consider resting heart rate.

**%HRR (Heart Rate Reserve)** accounts for an individual’s resting heart rate. Heart rate reserve is defined as:
> HR<sub>max</sub> – HR<sub>rest</sub>. 

%HRR is given by the **Karvonen formula**:  
> *%HRR = [(Exercise HR – HR<sub>rest</sub>) / (HR<sub>max</sub> – HR<sub>rest</sub>)] × 100%*.  

  As an example, consider a person with HR<sub>max</sub> 200 and resting HR 60. At an exercise HR of 150 bpm:  
  – %HR<sub>max</sub> = 150/200 = 75%  
  – %HRR = (150−60) / (200−60) = 90/140 ≈ **64%**.  
  This shows how %HRR is typically lower than %HR<sub>max</sub> for the same absolute heart rate, if resting HR is above zero. In fact, in this example 75% HR<sub>max</sub> corresponds to 64% of heart rate reserve.

**Why use %HRR?** The advantage of %HRR is that it correlates better with **%VO₂max or %VO₂ reserve**, which are measures of actual metabolic intensity. Resting heart rate differs between individuals (a very fit person may have a resting HR of 40, an unfit person 80, for instance). At a given %HR<sub>max</sub>, the person with a higher resting HR is actually working relatively less hard (because their heart rate hasn’t risen as far above their resting level). %HRR corrects for this by basing intensity on how much of the **available heart rate range** (from rest to max) is being used. Exercise science studies have shown that **%HRR has a nearly 1:1 relationship with %VO₂ reserve (VO₂R)** ([Relationship between %HRmax, %HR reserve, %VO2max, and %VO2 reserve in elite cyclists - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17277600/#:~:text=70%2C%20and%2085,HRR%20%28P%20%3C%200.001)). In one analysis of elite cyclists, the regression line for %HRR vs. %VO₂R had a slope ~1.00 and intercept near 0 (essentially identity), indicating that, for example, 50% HRR corresponds to ~50% of VO₂ reserve ([Relationship between %HRmax, %HR reserve, %VO2max, and %VO2 reserve in elite cyclists - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17277600/#:~:text=slope%20%281.069%20%2B%2F,HRR%20%28P%20%3C%200.001)). By contrast, %HR<sub>max</sub> and %VO₂max don’t line up as neatly – at lower intensities, %HR<sub>max</sub> tends to *overestimate* the equivalent %VO₂max ([Relationship between %HRmax, %HR reserve, %VO2max, and %VO2 reserve in elite cyclists - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17277600/#:~:text=Results%3A%20%20Below%2085,HRR%20at%20and)). In practical terms, **training zones based on %HRR are more robust**: A target of 70% HRR will produce a similar relative effort in different individuals, whereas 70% HR<sub>max</sub> might be a very different workload for a person with an unusually high or low resting pulse.

**When each is used:** %HR<sub>max</sub> is widely used in everyday training advice and by many fitness devices because it’s straightforward – you only need to know HR<sub>max</sub>. It’s useful for approximate zones (as in the table above) and for general population guidelines. %HRR is often used in formal exercise prescription (e.g., cardiac rehab or high-precision training programs) where individual tailoring is important. The **American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM)** recommends prescribing aerobic exercise intensity in terms of either **%HRR or %VO₂R (which are equivalent)**, because of their better alignment, but also provides approximate equivalents in %HR<sub>max</sub> ([Running Heart Rate: What’s Safe and What’s Too High?](https://www.healthline.com/health/running-heart-rate#:~:text=,of%20maximum%20heart%20rate)). For example, ACSM defines moderate intensity as 40–59% HRR, which corresponds roughly to 64–76% HR<sub>max</sub> ([Running Heart Rate: What’s Safe and What’s Too High?](https://www.healthline.com/health/running-heart-rate#:~:text=,of%20maximum%20heart%20rate)). In practice, if you have a measured or estimated HR<sub>max</sub> and a known resting HR, using %HRR (Karvonen method) will give you training zones that more closely match your true physiologic intensity. %HR<sub>max</sub> remains an acceptable shorthand; just remember that **65% HR<sub>max</sub> for one person may not feel the same as 65% for another person** with a different resting HR. Coaches and athletes often use %HRR for finer control, especially when comparing athletes or setting zones relative to VO₂max efforts ([Relationship between %HRmax, %HR reserve, %VO2max, and %VO2 reserve in elite cyclists - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17277600/#:~:text=slope%20%281.069%20%2B%2F,HRR%20%28P%20%3C%200.001)).
